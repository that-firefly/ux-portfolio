<!-- Therac-25 -->

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Therac-25</h2>
        <p>Therac-25 was a radiation therapy machine used in hospitals in the 1980s.<br>
A UI design flaw allowed technicians to accidentally administer massive overdoses of radiation,
killing at least six patients and seriously injuring others.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The UX/UI mistake:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The interface was confusing & misleading. Operators could enter treatment settings too quickly <br>(before the machine registered changes) and the system would default to a high-radiation mode without warning.</li>
            <li>No error messages were properly displayed. When an error occurred, the system still looked like it was working correctly. <br>Technicians thought everything was fine, but patients were getting fatal doses of radiation.</li>
            <li>Prototyping in HTML, using GitHub for version control and seamless collaboration
                with developers.</li>
            <li>No failsafe mechanisms. The system relied too much on software controls, removing the physical safety interlocks that previous models had.</li>
        </ul>
         <h2>Lesson Learned:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Never assume users will interact perfectly with a system.</li>
            <li>Clear feedback & fail-safes are essential in UX - especially in critical systems.</li>
            <li>Don’t remove safety features in favor of "efficiency".</li>
            <li>UX isn’t just about making things look nice. It can literally be a matter of life and death.</li>
        </ul>

<!-- The Post Office Horizon Scandal (UK) -->

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Post Office Horizon Scandal (UK) - UX Destroyed Lives.</h2>
        <p>The UK Post Office Horizon IT system (by Fujitsu) falsely accused hundreds of postmasters of financial fraud due to bad <br>software & UX flaws (1999-2015). The system had glitches that created accounting errors, making it look like money was missing. Postmasters were wrongly prosecuted, leading to prison sentences, suicides, bankruptcies, and ruined reputations.</p>

        <h2>The UX/UI mistake:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No error handling. The system showed incorrect financial losses but had no way for users to verify or correct them.</li>
            <li>Lack of transparency. Postmasters weren’t told about known system errors.</li>
            <li>Complex, unusable UI. Staff couldn't track down errors due to confusing workflows and hidden data.</li>
        </ul>
         <h2>Lesson Learned:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Accountability in UX is critical.</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Boeing 737 MAX (2018) - A UX Disaster That Killed 346 People</h2>
        <p>Boeing introduced a new flight control system (MCAS) to the 737 MAX aircraft but failed to inform pilots about how it worked. <br>A single sensor failure could trigger the system, pushing the plane’s nose down uncontrollably. Due to a lack of proper alerts and UI feedback, pilots couldn’t override it—resulting in two fatal crashes (Lion Air & Ethiopian Airlines), killing 346 people.</p>

            <li>No clear warnings. The system didn’t properly alert pilots when it activated.</li>

        <h2>Three Mile Island Nuclear Disaster (1979) – Confusing UI Led to a Meltdown</h2>
        <p>A partial meltdown occurred at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant (USA) due to a combination of UX design flaws and operator confusion.<br> The warning system was a mess—instead of clear, actionable alerts, it overloaded operators with hundreds of vague alarms.<br> Operators misinterpreted faulty indicators, shutting down the wrong systems and making the situation worse.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Volkswagen Emissions Scandal (2015) – UX Was Used to Deceive.</h2>
        <p>Volkswagen designed their diesel cars to cheat emissions tests by using software that detected when the car was being tested and <br>adjusted emissions accordingly. This made it seem like the cars were environmentally friendly when, in reality, they were pumping out illegal pollution levels.</p>

        <p>McDonald’s introduced self-order kiosks, which were designed to increase upsells. But they purposely made it hard to remove <br>extra charges (e.g., "extra cheese" was selected by default). In some cases, it even added fees without users noticing.</p>
