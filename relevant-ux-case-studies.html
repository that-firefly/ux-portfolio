                        <h3>1. Therac-25: The UX Failure That Led to Deaths.</h3>
                        <p>Therac-25 was a radiation therapy machine used in hospitals in the 1980s. A UI design flaw
                            allowed technicians to accidentally administer massive overdoses of
                            radiation, killing at least six patients and seriously injuring others.</p>

                        <p><strong>The UX/UI Mistake:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The interface was confusing & misleading</strong>. Operators could enter
                                treatment
                                settings too quickly (before the machine registered changes) and the system would
                                default to a high-radiation mode without warning.</li>
                            <li><strong>No error messages were properly displayed</strong>. When an error occurred, the
                                system still
                                looked like it was working correctly. Technicians thought everything was fine, but
                                patients were getting fatal doses of radiation.</li>
                            <li><strong>No failsafe mechanisms</strong>. The system relied too much on software
                                controls,
                                removing the physical safety interlocks that previous models had.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Never assume users will interact perfectly with a system.</li>
                            <li>Clear feedback & fail-safes are essential in UX - especially in critical systems.</li>
                            <li>Don‚Äôt remove safety features in favor of "efficiency".</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>UX isn‚Äôt just about making things look nice. It can literally be a matter of life and death.
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. The Post Office Horizon Scandal (UK) - UX Destroyed Lives.</h3>
                        <p>The UK Post Office Horizon IT system (by Fujitsu) falsely accused hundreds of postmasters of
                            financial fraud due to bad software & UX flaws (1999-2015). The system had glitches that
                            created accounting errors, making it look like money was missing. Postmasters were wrongly
                            prosecuted, leading to prison sentences, suicides, bankruptcies, and ruined reputations.</p>
                        <p><strong>The UX/UI Mistake:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>No error handling</strong>. The system showed incorrect financial losses but had
                                no way for users to verify or correct them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of transparency</strong>. Postmasters weren‚Äôt told about known system
                                errors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Complex, unusable UI</strong>. Staff couldn't track down errors due to confusing
                                workflows and hidden data.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>3. Boeing 737 MAX (2018) - A UX Disaster That Killed 346 People</h3>
                        <p>Boeing introduced a new flight control system (MCAS) to the 737 MAX aircraft but failed to
                            inform pilots about how it worked. A single sensor failure could trigger the system, pushing
                            the plane‚Äôs nose down uncontrollably. Due to a lack of proper alerts and UI feedback, pilots
                            couldn‚Äôt override it‚Äîresulting in two fatal crashes (Lion Air & Ethiopian Airlines), killing
                            346 people.</p>
                        <p><strong>The UX/UI Mistake:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Lack of visibility</strong>. Pilots didn‚Äôt know about MCAS or how to disable it.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>No clear warnings</strong>. The system didn‚Äôt properly alert pilots when it
                                activated.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hidden design flaws</strong>. Boeing tried to minimize costs by not requiring
                                extra pilot training, assuming pilots would ‚Äújust figure it out‚Äù.</li>

                        <h3>4. Three Mile Island Nuclear Disaster (1979) ‚Äì Confusing UI Led to a Meltdown</h3>
                        <p>A partial meltdown occurred at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant (USA) due to a
                            combination of UX design flaws and operator confusion. The warning system was a mess‚Äîinstead
                            of clear, actionable alerts, it overloaded operators with hundreds of vague alarms.
                            Operators misinterpreted faulty indicators, shutting down the wrong systems and making the
                            situation worse.</p>
                        <p><strong>The UX/UI Mistake:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Overwhelming alerts</strong>. The interface bombarded operators with too much
                                data at once, making it impossible to tell what was critical.</li>
                            <li><strong>Misleading indicators</strong>. The UI showed that a valve was closed when it
                                was actually open, leading to coolant loss.</li>
                            <li><strong>No hierarchy of importance</strong>. Everything looked equally urgent, so
                                operators couldn‚Äôt focus on what actually mattered.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Volkswagen designed their diesel cars to cheat emissions tests by using software that
                            detected when the car was being tested and adjusted emissions accordingly. This made it seem
                            like the cars were environmentally friendly when, in reality, they were pumping out illegal
                            pollution levels.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Deceptive UI</strong>. The dashboard showed fake data, making both regulators
                                and users believe the cars were "clean".</li>
                            <li><strong>Hidden behavior</strong>. There was no way for users to detect that the car was
                                running in "cheat mode".</li>

                        <h3>6. McDonald‚Äôs Touchscreens & Hidden Fees (2018).</h3>
                        <p>McDonald‚Äôs introduced self-order kiosks, which were designed to increase upsells. But they
                            purposely made it hard to remove extra charges (e.g., "extra cheese" was selected by
                            default). In some cases, it even added fees without users noticing.</p>
                        <p><strong>The UX/UI Mistake:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dark patterns</strong>. The UI tricked users into spending more money by making
                                removal options hard to find.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of transparency</strong>. The total cost wasn‚Äôt always clearly updated.
