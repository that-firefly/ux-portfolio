        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <h3>A closed-loop energy system that operates on a fixed energy input and replenishes itself using internal regenerative sources.</h3>
       



        <p>One of my favourite things to do is ideate and imagine bold solutions to real-world problems.
            When I am in nature or drawing I come up will ideas for things that I observe in real life
            and stay in my mind waiting for... ideation.
        </p>
        <p>If the idea sparks something in you, feel free to build on it — I’d genuinely love to see it
            come to life. I just ask that you bring me along for the journey and consider collaborating.
            Projects like these make me feel truly alive - they give purpose to design and turn
            creativity into something deeply meaningful.</p>
        <p>Imagine the following... It’s a warm afternoon. People stroll down the park-side pathway,
            cyclists glide by, and a steady stream of electric cars hum across the nearby road. All of
            them - unknowingly - are part of a dynamic, intelligent energy ecosystem beneath their feet.
        </p>

    <p>Suddenly, a power outage occurs in a nearby neighbourhood. But instead of a blackout, the
        <strong>smart road responds like a living organism</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Just like blood redirects to an injured area, the <strong>ElectroFlow Circuit</strong>
        reroutes stored energy
        through its <strong>self-regulating microgrid</strong>. The system pulls reserve power from
        three key
        sources:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Kinetic energy</strong> generated by vehicles and pedestrian movement (via
            pressure-sensitive tiles and road coils).</li>
        <li><strong>Solar panels</strong> embedded in road dividers and rooftops.</li>
        <li><strong>Residual charge</strong> from EVs decelerating or braking.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It also only uses an certain amount of energy that doesnt disappear because it gets
        replaced... its a closed live circuit.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the <strong>user-facing experience</strong> (via app or public display panels)
        shows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Live energy levels of each road segment.</li>
        <li>Areas currently "donating" or "receiving" power.</li>
        <li>Suggestions for energy-saving routes and optimal times for EV charging.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The road even <strong>communicates with emergency services</strong>, ensuring that vital
        energy routes are prioritized — just like arteries protecting the heart.
    <p>
    <p>
        To the average citizen? Everything appears calm, efficient, and uninterrupted.
        To the designers, engineers, and UX minds behind it? It’s the future of <strong>civic
            infrastructure
            as a living system.</strong>
