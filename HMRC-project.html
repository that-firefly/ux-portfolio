        <h2>About the project(s)</h2>
        <h3>As part of the UK government’s initiative to digitise tax reporting, <br>I contributed to the
            Make Tax Digital (MTD) for Property Income Tax Submission project. The goal was to
            streamline <br>the process for landlords and property owners, ensuring a seamless and efficient
            way to report income tax digitally.</h3>

        <p>The Advanced Ruling Service (ARS) is a key initiative aimed at providing businesses and
            individuals with clear, binding tax rulings before transactions take place. <br>This service
            helps taxpayers gain certainty on complex tax matters, minimising risks and ensuring
            compliance with regulations.</p>
        <h3>About His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC)</h3>
        <p>His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HRMC) is a non-ministerial department, supported by two
            agencies (Valuation Office Agency and The Adjudicator's Office ) and public bodies.
        </p>
        <p>HMRC was established by an Act of Parliament in 2005 as a new department, replacing the
            Inland Revenue and Customs & Excise.</p>
        <p>Its purpose is to collect money to pay for public services and provide financial support.
        </p>

        <p>HMRC assisted 2.4 million customers in renewing their tax credits in 2021 and supported 10.3
            million customers in completing their Self Assessment returns.</p>
        <p>This government organisation also supports more than 12 million children with Child Benefit
            and 458,000 through Tax-Free Childcare.
        </p>
        <p>HMRC puts the focus on prioritising essential customer services and building a modern tax and
            customs department since this will potentially ensure tax compliance.

        <p>Making Tax Digital for Income Tax (MTD) is part of the government’s Tax Administration
            Strategy which is trying to reduce the tax gap * by requiring businesses and individuals to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep digital records.
            </li>
            <li>Use software that works with Making Tax Digital.</li>
            <li>Submit updates every quarter, bringing the tax system closer to real-time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>MTD for Income Tax is due to be introduced in April 2026 and will affect self-employed
            individuals and individuals receiving property income with annual gross income of £30,000 or
            more.
        </p>

        <p>Thus, I was invited to the MTD for Income Tax project to work on the income property journey
            (UK and International for FHL (Furnished Holiday Lettings), Rentals and Rent a room).
        </p>
        <p>Self-employed individuals and individuals must inform HMRC of the property income even if
            they are making a loss from a property and pay tax on the net rental profit only. <br>This
            applies to all rental income and expenses including lettings on UK and overseas properties.
        </p>
        <p>This meant that these journeys were long and complex due to the accounting/tax nature and law
            requirements, involving a lot of strategic thinking, <br>user interface and content design work.
            User experience is critical for effective Self Assessment tax returns.

        <h3>What did my UX and UI practice look like?</h3>
        <p>Digital income tax submission has different dimensions and I was invited to work on the
            income property journey (UK and International for FHL (Furnished Holiday Lettings), <br>Rentals
            and Rent a room), where I created and edited pages, linked journeys, looked at background
            research and performed not just an user interface role but also contributed <br>with my user
            experience (UX) expertise background by selecting and understanding what GDS components and
            patterns would be more suitable to serve the user.
