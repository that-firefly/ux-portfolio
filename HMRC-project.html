                        <h3>As part of the UK governmentâ€™s initiative to digitise tax reporting, I contributed to the
                            Make Tax Digital (MTD) for Property Income Tax Submission project. The goal was to
                            streamline the process for landlords and property owners, ensuring a seamless and efficient
                            way to report income tax digitally.</h3>

                        <p>The Advanced Ruling Service (ARS) is a key initiative aimed at providing businesses and
                            individuals with clear, binding tax rulings before transactions take place. This service
                            helps taxpayers gain certainty on complex tax matters, minimising risks and ensuring
                            compliance with regulations.</p>
                        <h3>About His Majestyâ€™s Revenue and Customs (HMRC)</h3>
                        <p>His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HRMC) is a non-ministerial department, supported by two
                            agencies (Valuation Office Agency and The Adjudicator's Office ) and public bodies.
                        </p>
                        <p>HMRC was established by an Act of Parliament in 2005 as a new department, replacing the
                            Inland Revenue and Customs & Excise.</p>
                        <p>Its purpose is toÂ collect money to pay for public services and provide financial support.

                        <p>Making Tax Digital for Income Tax (MTD) is part of the governmentâ€™s Tax Administration
                            Strategy which is trying to reduce the tax gap * by requiring businesses and individuals to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep digital records.
                            </li>
                            <li>Use software that works with Making Tax Digital.</li>
                            <li>Submit updates every quarter, bringing the tax system closer to real-time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>MTD for Income Tax is due to be introduced in April 2026 and will affect self-employed
                            individuals and individuals receiving property income with annual gross income of Â£30,000 or
                            more.

                        <p>Thus, I was invited to the MTD for Income Tax project to work on the income property journey
                            (UK and International for FHL (Furnished Holiday Lettings), Rentals and Rent a room).
                        </p>
                        <p>Self-employed individuals and individuals must inform HMRC of the property income even if
                            they are making a loss from a property and pay tax on the net rental profit only. This
                            applies to all rental income and expenses including lettings on UK and overseas properties.
                        </p>
                        <p>This meant that these journeys were long and complex due to the accounting/tax nature and law
                            requirements, involving a lot of strategic thinking, user interface and content design work.
                            User experience is critical for effective Self Assessment tax returns.

                        <p>Digital income tax submission has different dimensions and I was invited to work on the
                            income property journey (UK and International for FHL (Furnished Holiday Lettings), Rentals
                            and Rent a room), where I created and edited pages, linked journeys, looked at background
                            research and performed not just an user interface role but also contributed with my user
                            experience (UX) expertise background by selecting and understanding what GDS components and
                            patterns would be more suitable to serve the user.
