                        <p>Xanthos Digital, established in 2002 and based in Ely, Cambridgeshire, is a dedicated digital
                            marketing agency committed to supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in
                            achieving measurable growth and maximising return on investment.</p>
                        <p>Their comprehensive range of services includes digital strategy development, SEO, PPC
                            management, email marketing, web design, and e-commerce solutions. These services are
                            expertly tailored to enhance clients' online presence and drive sustainable success.</p>
                        <p>During my tenure as a Senior Designer at Xanthos Digital, I was responsible for leading
                            client meetings to understand their unique needs and objectives, translating these into
                            well-defined design briefs. I managed a small team of content and web designers, overseeing
                            the entire design and development process from wireframing and prototypingâ€”using tools like
                            Axureâ€”through to final implementation. Additionally, I gathered post-development feedback to
                            inform sales strategies and ensure continuous improvement.</p>
                        <p>A significant aspect of my role involved designing book covers for best-selling IT
                            publications, a task that required distilling complex, abstract technological concepts into
                            captivating visual narratives. Furthermore, I developed branding and digital print materials
                            for both B2B and B2C clients, maintaining consistency across all platforms. My expertise
                            extended to creating responsive websites following usability best practices, utilising
                            content management systems such as Kentico and WordPress to deliver user-friendly
                            experiences.</p>
                        <p>My design process encompassed several key phases:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span>Discovery and Planning:</span> Defining business goals, target audiences, and core
                                functionalities; conducting competitor research within the industry; and selecting the
                                most suitable e-commerce platforms.</li>
                            <li><span>Design and UX/UI:</span> Developing wireframes to map out the site structure,
                                establishing a visual style consistent with brand identity, and designing intuitive
                                layouts to facilitate seamless navigation.</li>
                            <li><span>Development and Integration:</span> Implementing both front- and back-end
                                development to bring designs to life, integrating essential tools, and ensuring robust
                                functionality.</li>
                            <li><span>Content Creation and Management:</span> Entering product details, optimising
                                content for search engines, and implementing content management systems to enable
                                straightforward updates.</li>
                            <li><span>Testing and Quality Assurance:</span> Ensuring cross-browser and device
                                compatibility, conducting thorough security audits, and adding SSL encryption to protect
                                customer data.</li>
                            <li><span>Launch and Deployment:</span> Performing comprehensive final reviews, configuring
                                hosting and domain settings, migrating sites to live environments, and monitoring
                                performance to promptly address any initial issues.</li>
                            <li><span>Ongoing Maintenance and Optimisation:</span> Keeping plugins, platforms, and
                                security features current, monitoring key performance metrics such as page load speed
                                and conversion rates, and regularly updating product information.</li>
                        </ol>
