        <p>During my tenure as a Senior Designer at Xanthos Digital, I was responsible for leading
            client meetings to understand their unique needs <br>and objectives, translating these into
            well-defined design briefs. I managed a small team of content and web designers, overseeing
            the <br>entire design and development process from wireframing and prototyping, using tools
            like Axure, through to final implementation. <br>Additionally, I gathered post-development feedback
            to inform sales strategies and ensure continuous improvement.</p>

        <p>A significant aspect of my role involved designing book covers for best-selling IT
            publications, a task that required distilling complex, <br>abstract technological concepts into
            captivating visual narratives. Furthermore, I developed branding and digital print materials
            for both B2B and B2C clients, <br>maintaining consistency across all platforms. My expertise
            extended to creating responsive websites following usability best practices, utilising<br>
            content management systems such as Kentico and WordPress to deliver user-friendly
            experiences.</p>
