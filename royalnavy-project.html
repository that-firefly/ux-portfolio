                        <h3>What did my UX and UI practice look like?</h3>
                        <p>We conducted reserach to understand who were our main users and what problems their were
                            facing relatively to the access of e-learning.</p>
                        <p>We discovered that personnel at various stages of their careersâ€”recruits, active service
                            members, and those transitioning to civilian lifeâ€”access the e-learning platform. To ensure
                            comprehensive insights, we engaged with a wide range of stakeholders, from recruits to
                            officers.</p>

                        <p>Research and workshops were conducted to identify the main challenges and explore potential
                            solutions to improve platform accessibility. We performed research on the use of the RN
                            eLearning platform (DLE), its current and potential users, their habits, emotions and
                            frustrations. We then prototyped changes and improvements that were tested in different
                            sprints alongside an implementation culture program to change the mindset and facilitate
                            adoption.</p>
                        <p>Following a bespoke Design Thinking method to accomodate the hierarchy nature of the military
                            life, we served primarily a critical number of users, tested and iterated on solution
                            hypothesis by involving the client at each stage on presentation of findings sessions and
                            workshops.</p>

                        <p>During this initial research phase, I visited various Royal Navy establishments throughout
                            the country, such as BRNC Dartmouth, HMS Collingwood, CTCRM Lympstone and HMS Raleigh, and
                            facilitated workshops to assess the platform's current state. Conducted
                            as-is evaluations with recruits and trainers to identify key areas for improvement.</p>

                        <p>We created several deliverables such as business process mapping, impact maps and risk
                            assessments, ecosystem maps, stakeholder maps, persona and empathy mapping, user journeys,
                            user flows, different flowcharts, reports with key findings and advisory solutions based on
                            solid problem solving and UX hypothesis. We also created living prototypes using the legacy
                            system that we tested throughout the project and a custom-made design system.</p>

                        <p>We made service design recommendations to improve access to e-learning by scoping personas,
                            tasks and goals; mapping user journeys, conducting workshops and interviews face-to-face and
                            remote (using Teams) from different RN establisments, and by trying to understand current
                            challenges. We also collaborated with the RN key stakeholders to change the culture,
                            consolidate and incorporate a more agile mindset so we could have effective adoption to the
                            e-learning platform.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We identified and addressed several areas for improvement, including:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <p><strong>Enhanced accessibility:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mobile optimisation. Necessary seamless access across devices, including smartphones
                                    and
                                    tablets, for learning on the go.</li>
                                <li>Offline mode. The need for downloadable content for remote operations with limited
                                    internet connectivity such as in ships.</li>
                                <li>Single sign-On (SSO). Easier login integration with MoD systems.</li>
                                <li>User-friendly interface. Simplified navigation for quick access to courses and
                                    materials.</li>
                                <li>Adaptive learning paths that could also incentivise further learning and critical
                                    thought. Customisable courses based on role, experience, and prior knowledge.</li>

                                <p><strong>Agile military training:</strong></p>

                                <li>Microlearning modules. Short, focused lessons for rapid skill development.</li>
                                <li>Scenario-based simulations and up-front recommended learning. Interactive case study
                                    exercises and recommended learning paths designed to prepare recruits for potential
                                    future situations.</li>

                                <p><strong>Improved collaboration & engagement:</strong></p>
                                <li>Gamification. Leaderboards, badges, and challenges to boost engagement.</li>
                                <li>Peer learning & forums. Encourage knowledge-sharing and discussions.</li>
                                <li>Cross-branch learning. Standardised training across the Royal Navy, Army, and RAF.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
