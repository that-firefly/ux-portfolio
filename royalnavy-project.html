      <h2>About the project(s)</h2>
      <h3>Enhancing the Defence Learning Environment (DLE), the Royal Navy’s e-learning platform, to
        improve training accessibility, <br>flexibility, and effectiveness—ensuring cadets receive
        solid, upfront training that accelerates their preparation for further offline instruction.</h3>

      <p>The <strong>Defence Learning Environment (DLE)</strong> is the Royal Navy’s (and broader UK
        Defence) E-Learning platform, designed to enhance training accessibility, flexibility, and
        effectiveness.</p>

      <h3>What did my UX and UI practice look like?</h3>
      <p>We conducted reserach to understand who were our main users and what problems their were
        facing relatively to the access of e-learning.</p>
      <p>We discovered that personnel at various stages of their careers (recruits, active service
        members, and those transitioning to civilian life) access the e-learning platform. <br>To ensure
        comprehensive insights, we engaged with a wide range of stakeholders, from recruits to
        officers.</p>

    <!-- Phase 1: Discovery / Research -->
    <h2 class="case-section">1 - Discovery & Research</h2>
    <p>Research and workshops were conducted to identify the main challenges and explore potential
      solutions to improve platform accessibility.<br> We performed research on the use of the RN
      eLearning platform (DLE), its current and potential users, their habits, emotions and
      frustrations. <br>We then prototyped changes and improvements that were tested in different
      sprints alongside an implementation culture program to change the mindset and facilitate
      adoption.</p>

    <p>Following a bespoke Design Thinking method to accomodate the hierarchy nature of the military
      life, we served primarily a critical number of users, tested <br>and iterated on solution
      hypothesis by involving the client at each stage on presentation of findings sessions and
      workshops.</p>

    <p>During this initial research phase, I visited various Royal Navy establishments throughout
      the country, such as BRNC Dartmouth, HMS Collingwood,<br> CTCRM Lympstone and HMS Raleigh, and
      facilitated workshops to assess the platform's current state. Conducted
      as-is evaluations with recruits and trainers to identify key areas for improvement.</p>

    <!-- Phase 2: Synthesis / Definition -->
    <h2 class="case-section">2 - Synthesis & Definition</h2>
    <p>We created several deliverables such as business process mapping,<br> impact maps and risk
      assessments, ecosystem maps, stakeholder maps, persona and empathy mapping, user journeys,
      user flows, different flowcharts, <br>reports with key findings and advisory solutions based on
      solid problem solving and UX hypothesis. We also created living prototypes using the legacy
      user flows, different flowcharts, <br>reports with key findings and advisory solutions based on
      system that we tested throughout the project and a custom-made design system.</p>

    <!-- Phase 3: Ideation / Service Design -->
    <h2 class="case-section">3 - Ideation & Service Design</h2>
    <p>We made service design recommendations to improve access to e-learning by scoping personas,
      tasks and goals; mapping user journeys, <br>conducting workshops and interviews face-to-face and
      remote (using Teams) from different RN establisments, <br>and by trying to understand current
      challenges. We also collaborated with the RN key stakeholders to change the culture,
      consolidate and incorporate <br>a more agile mindset so we could have effective adoption to the
      e-learning platform.</p>

    </p>

    <!-- Phase 4: Prototyping & Testing -->
    <h2 class="case-section">4 - Prototyping & Testing</h2>
    <p>We identified and addressed several areas for improvement, including:</p>
    <ol>
      <p><strong>Enhanced accessibility:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile optimisation. Necessary seamless access across devices, including smartphones
          and tablets, for learning on the go.</li>
        <li>Offline mode. The need for downloadable content for remote operations with limited
          internet connectivity such as in ships.</li>
        <li>Single sign-On (SSO). Easier login integration with MoD systems.</li>
        <li>User-friendly interface. Simplified navigation for quick access to courses and
          materials.</li>
        <li>Adaptive learning paths that could also incentivise further learning and critical
          thought. Customisable courses based on role, experience, and prior knowledge.</li>

        <p><strong>Agile military training:</strong></p>

        <li>Microlearning modules. Short, focused lessons for rapid skill development.</li>
        <li>Scenario-based simulations and up-front recommended learning. Interactive case study
          exercises and recommended <br>learning paths designed to prepare recruits for potential
          future situations.</li>

        <p><strong>Improved collaboration & engagement:</strong></p>
        <li>Gamification. Leaderboards, badges, and challenges to boost engagement.</li>
        <li>Peer learning & forums. Encourage knowledge-sharing and discussions.</li>
        <li>Cross-branch learning. Standardised training across the Royal Navy, Army, and RAF.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <!-- Phase 5: Adoption, Handover & Next Steps -->
    <h2 class="case-section">5 - Adoption, Handover & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>We then prototyped changes and improvements that were tested in different
      sprints alongside an implementation culture program to change the mindset and facilitate
      adoption.</p>
