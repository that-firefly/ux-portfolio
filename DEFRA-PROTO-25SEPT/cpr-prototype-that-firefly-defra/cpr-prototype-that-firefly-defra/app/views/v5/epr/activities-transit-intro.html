          Did your organisation place any transit packaging on the UK market in 2022?

        <p>
          Transit packaging is packaging conceived to aid handling and transport of a number of sales units or grouped packs in order to prevent physical handling and transport damage. Transit packaging does not include road, rail, ship and air containers.

          <p><strong>Example A</strong></p>
          <p>A chemical manufacturer sells barrels of the chemical they produce to a pharmaceutical organisation. The manufacturer transports the barrels to the pharmaceutical organisation on shrink-wrapped crates. </p>
          <p>The transit packaging is the shrink-wrap and crates. </p>
          <p><strong>Example B</strong></p>
          <p>An online marketplace facilitates the sale of clothing by a non-UK based producer. The online marketplace adds bubble wrap and a cardboard box to the clothing, to deliver it to the end consumer.</p>
          <p>The transit packaging is the bubble wrap and cardboard box.</p>
