          Did your organisation place any secondary packaging on the UK market in 2022?

        <p>
          Secondary packaging is packaging conceived to group a certain number of sales units whether sold to the final user or consumer or a means to stock shelves at the point of sale. It can be removed from the product without affecting its characteristics. 
        </p>

            <p><strong>Example A</strong></p>
            <p>An organisation sells individually boxed ink cartridges, grouped in a cardboard tray covered in plastic wrap, to a retail organisation. </p>
            <p>The retail organisation removes the plastic wrap, disposes of it and displays the ink cartridges on shelves in the cardboard trays. It sells the ink cartridges individually. </p>
            <p>The secondary packaging is the cardboard trays and the plastic wrap. </p>
            <p><strong>Example B - not secondary packaging</strong></p>
            <p>An organisation sells individually boxed ink cartridges, grouped in a cardboard tray covered in plastic wrap, to an end consumer. </p>
            <p>In this example, the cardboard tray and plastic wrap are primary packaging, because theyâ€™re sold to the end consumer as part of the sales unit. </p>
