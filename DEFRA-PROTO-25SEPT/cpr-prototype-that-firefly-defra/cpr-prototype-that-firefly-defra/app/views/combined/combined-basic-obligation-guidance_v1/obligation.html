        <p>The collection and packaging reforms include two schemes, extended producer responsibility (EPR) and the
            deposit return scheme (DRS). Businesses may need to register for one or both schemes.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">EPR scheme criteria</h3>

        <p>Your business must register for the EPR scheme if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>it had a turnover above £1 million in its last financial year</li>
            <li>it produced or placed 25 or more tonnes of packaging on the UK market between 1 January 2022 and 31
                December 2022</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">DRS scheme criteria</h3>

        <p>Your business must register for the DRS scheme if it carries out at least one of these activities:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>fills drinks containers with its own branded drinks to place on the market in England, Wales or Northern
                Ireland</li>
            <li>imports filled drinks containers from outside of the UK to place on the market in England, Wales or
                Northern Ireland</li>
            <li>sells filled drinks containers to end consumers in England, Wales or Northern Ireland</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            If you’re not sure, you can <a href="">check if your business needs to register for the schemes</a>.
