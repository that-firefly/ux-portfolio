          <p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
          <p>Primary packaging is what goods are contained in when sold to the end consumer. It’s sometimes called a ‘sales unit’.</p>  
          <p><strong>Example A</strong></p>
            <p>A crisp manufacturer sells large cardboard boxes containing individual packets of crisps to a supermarket. The supermarket sells the packets of crisps individually.</p>
            <p>The primary packaging is each individual crisp packet.</p>
            <p><strong>Example B</strong></p>
            <p>A crisp manufacturer sells large cardboard boxes containing individual packets of crisps to a wholesaler. The wholesaler sells full boxes of individual packets of crisps. </p>
            <p>The primary packaging is the cardboard boxes and the individual crisp packets.</p>
