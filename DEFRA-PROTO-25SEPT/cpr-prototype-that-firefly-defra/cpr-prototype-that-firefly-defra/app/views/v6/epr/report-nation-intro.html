          Report your organisation's nation data for 2022
        </h1>

        <p>As part of the EPR regulations, your organisation must report packaging data for goods it sold in each nation. This means telling us how much packaging you sold in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p>

        <p>There are no fees associated with this data. We need it so that we can measure against recycling rate targets. </p>

        <p>You should include any packaging used in reporting by nation activities you told us you carried out in 2022. </p>
