        <p>Secondary packaging is used to group a number of ‘sales units’. Organisations sometimes use it to display goods in shops or sell it to the end consumer along with the goods it contains.</p>

          <p><strong>Example A</strong></p>
          <p>An organisation sells individually boxed ink cartridges, grouped in a cardboard tray covered in plastic wrap, to a retail organisation.</p>
          <p>The retail organisation removes the plastic wrap, disposes of it and displays the ink cartridges on shelves in the cardboard trays. It sells the ink cartridges individually.</p>
          <p>The secondary packaging is the cardboard trays and the plastic wrap.</p>
          <p><strong>Example B - not secondary packaging</strong></p>
          <p>An organisation sells individually boxed ink cartridges, grouped in a cardboard tray covered in plastic wrap, to an end consumer.</p>
          <p>In this example, the cardboard tray and plastic wrap are primary packaging, because they’re sold to the end consumer as part of the sales unit.</p>
