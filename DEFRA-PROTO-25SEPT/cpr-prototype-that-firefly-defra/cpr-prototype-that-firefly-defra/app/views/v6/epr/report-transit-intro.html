        <p>Transit packaging does not include road, rail, ship and air containers.</p>

          <p><strong>Example A</strong></p>
          <p>A chemical manufacturer sells barrels of the chemical they produce to a pharmaceutical organisation. The manufacturer transports the barrels to the pharmaceutical organisation on shrink-wrapped crates.</p>
          <p>The transit packaging is the shrink-wrap and crates. </p>
          <p><strong>Example B</strong></p>
