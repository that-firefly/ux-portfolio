        <p>As part of the EPR regulations, you’ll need to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>tell us which packaging activities you carried out</li>
          <li>submit packaging data based on your packaging activities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We’ll ask you about your activities for each packaging category so that we can let you know what data to prepare.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Packaging definitions and examples</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Primary packaging</h3>
        <p>Primary packaging is what goods are contained in when sold to the end consumer. It’s sometimes called a ‘sales unit’.</p>
        <span style="width: 240px; height: 240px; display: block; float:left; margin-right: 30px;"><img src="/public/images/primary-packaging-illustration_640x640.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="A steel tin of peas with a paper label."></span>
        <p class="govuk-body-s"><strong>Example:</strong><br>Peas are placed into steel tins that have paper labels. The peas are sold to end consumers in these tins.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body-s"><strong>Primary packaging used:</strong><br>steel tin and paper label.</p>
        <hr style="clear: both; background-color: #FFFFFF; border: #FFFFFF; margin-bottom: 30px;">
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Secondary packaging</h3>
        <p>Secondary packaging is used to group a number of ‘sales units’. Organisations sometimes use it to display goods in shops or sell it to the end consumer along with the goods it contains.</p>
        <span style="width: 240px; height: 240px; display: block; float:left; margin-right: 30px;"><img src="/public/images/secondary-packaging-illustration_640x640.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="A large cardboard box containing multiple tins of peas."></span>
        <p class="govuk-body-s"><strong>Example:</strong><br>Multiple tins of peas are/the primary packaging is placed into cardboard boxes. These cardboard boxes are sold to retail organisations.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body-s"><strong>Secondary packaging used:</strong><br>cardboard box.</p>
        <hr style="clear: both; background-color: #FFFFFF; border: #FFFFFF; margin-bottom: 30px;">
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Transit packaging</h3>
        <p>Also known as 'tertiary packaging', transit packaging is what sales units or goods grouped in secondary packaging are contained in while they’re being transported or handled. It’s used to prevent damage to the goods.</p>
        <p>Transit packaging does not include road, rail, ship and air containers.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body-s"><strong>Example:</strong><br>The secondary packaging is placed into larger cardboard boxes that are sealed with parcel tape. These boxes are then put onto wooden pallets before they're transported.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body-s"><strong>Transit packaging used:</strong><br>cardboard box, parcel tape and wooden pallet.</p>
