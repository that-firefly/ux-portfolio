                <p class="govuk-body">The way UK organisations responsible for packaging must carry out their recycling responsibilities is changing.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you’re affected by the new extended producer responsibility (EPR) for packaging , you must take steps to collect the correct packaging data from 1 January 2023.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">The regulations will apply to all UK organisations that handle and supply packaging.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Under the new regulations, you may need to:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>collect and submit data on the packaging you handle and supply</li>
                        <li>pay a waste management fee</li>
                        <li>buy packaging waste recycling notes (PRNs) or packaging waste export recycling notes (PERNs) to meet your recycling obligations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">The steps you must take to comply with the regulations will depend on whether you are classed as a ‘small’ or ‘large’ organisation. This is based on:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>your annual turnover</li>
                        <li>how much packaging you handle and supply each year</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">If you sell packaged goods or empty packaging in the UK, you may also need to submit ‘nation data’. This is information about which country in the UK your packaging has been sold, hired or loaned in.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="#">use a compliance scheme</a> to complete certain steps on your behalf.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">If you're a small organisation</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You will be classed as a small organisation if either of the following apply:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>your annual turnover is between £1 million and £2 million and you’re responsible for handling and supplying more than 25 tonnes of empty packaging or packaged goods through the UK market</li>
                        <li>your annual turnover is over £1 million and you're responsible for handling and supplying between 25 tonnes and 50 tonnes of empty packaging or packaged goods through the UK market</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You should base your annual turnover on your most recent annual accounts.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Your total weight is the amount of packaging handled or supplied through the UK market in a calendar year (January to December).</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to submit your data between 1 January 2024 and 1 April 2024. If you miss the deadline, you may need to pay a penalty charge.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">If you're a large organisation</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You will be classed as a large organisation if both of the following apply:</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">If you’re a parent company, group or subsidiary</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">If you are a parent company that is responsible for a group of subsidiaries, you can either register for the EPR for packaging online service (registration opens in April 2023) as an individual organisation or on behalf of your group.</p>

                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>selling any filled packaging to consumers</li>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Your organisation should start preparing now to capture your packaging data.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Your data submission must include the weight of:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>individual materials in the packaging you handle and supply</li>
                        <li>materials used in your 'primary', 'secondary', 'shipment' and 'transit' packaging</li>
                        <li>packaging likely to become household or non-household waste</li>
                        <li>packaging likely to end up in street bins</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Your 2023 data will be used to calculate:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>your waste management fees in the financial year 2024 to 2025 by the scheme administrator</li>
                        <li>the amount of PRNs and PERNs you must buy to cover your 2024 recycling obligations by the regulator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="govuk-body">From 2025, the scheme administrator will adjust your waste management fees depending on the cost of recycling the materials used in your packaging you handle and supply.</p>


                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">How to report material type</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You must collect data on the weight of individual material types used in the packaging you handle and supply. Give all weights to the nearest tonne (1,000kg).</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You should categorise your data by the following materials:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>aluminium</li>
                        <li>fibre-based composite </li>
                        <li>glass</li>
                        <li>paper or cardboard</li>
                        <li>plastic</li>
                        <li>steel</li>
                        <li>wood</li>
                        <li>other</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, you may report that you have handled and supplied 20 tonnes of paper and 5 tonnes of plastic.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">If you report materials under ‘other’, you must state the weight of each material type. You must also state how much of each material is used in the ‘primary’, ‘secondary' or ‘transit’ packaging you handle and supply.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if you handled or supplied 20 tonnes of paper, you may report that you used:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>10 tonnes in primary packaging</li>
                        <li>10 tonnes in secondary packaging</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Primary packaging</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Primary packaging is the individual container that you store goods in to sell to consumers. This is called a ‘sales unit’.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if you sell peas in steel tins with paper labels, the primary packaging is ‘steel tin’ and ‘paper label’.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Secondary and shipment packaging</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Secondary packaging is for grouping several ‘sales units’ for selling or shipping purposes. Organisations may use secondary packaging to display goods in shops.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Shipment packaging is a type of secondary packaging for shipping single or multiple sales units to consumers. This includes cardboard boxes and mailing bags.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if you place one or more tins of peas into a cardboard box, then sell the box to a retailer or ship it to the consumer, the secondary packaging is ‘cardboard box’.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Or if you place a mobile phone in a cardboard box and then place the box into a mail bag before shipping it, the shipment packaging is ‘mail bag’. The primary packaging is ‘cardboard box’.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Transit or tertiary packaging is used to group secondary packaging units together to protect them while being transported or handled.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Transit packaging does not include road, rail, ship and air containers.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if secondary packaging units are placed into larger cardboard boxes that are sealed with parcel tape and put onto wooden pallets to be transported, the transit packaging is 'cardboard box, parcel tape and wooden pallet'.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Household and non-household packaging waste</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You must submit the weight of packaging that ends up (or is likely to end up) as household and non-household waste.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">When calculating your waste management fees for the financial year 2024 to 2025, the scheme administrator will treat all primary and shipment packaging as household waste, unless you have clear evidence that some or all of the packaging is unlikely to become household waste.</p>
