            A manufacturer who makes soup and fills steel cans with that soup. They put their brand on the label and sell the soup to supermarkets. </p>

            A supermarket, "A Ltd", has an own-brand range of coffee. They contract a manufacturer to make the coffee and put it in the packaging. The contractor also prints the label.
