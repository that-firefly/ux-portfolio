      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <h3>
        A closed-loop energy system that operates on a fixed energy input and
        replenishes itself using internal regenerative sources.
      </h3>

      <p>
        One of my favourite things to do is ideate and imagine bold solutions to
        real-world problems. When I am in nature or drawing I come up will ideas
        for things <br>that I observe in real life and stay in my mind waiting
        for... ideation.  If the idea sparks something in you, feel free to build on it — I’d
        genuinely love to see it come to life. <br>I just ask that you bring me
        along for the journey and consider collaborating. Projects like these
        make me feel truly alive - they give purpose to design and turn<br>
        creativity into something deeply meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine the following... It’s a warm afternoon. People stroll down the
        park-side pathway, cyclists glide by, and a steady stream of electric<br>
        cars hum across the nearby road. All of them - unknowingly - are part of
        a dynamic, intelligent energy ecosystem beneath their feet.

        Suddenly, a power outage occurs in a nearby neighbourhood. But instead
        of a blackout, the
        <strong>smart road responds like a living organism</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like blood redirects to an injured area, the
        <strong>ElectroFlow Circuit</strong> reroutes stored energy through its
        <strong>self-regulating microgrid</strong>. <br>The system pulls reserve
        power from three key sources:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Kinetic energy</strong> generated by vehicles and pedestrian
          movement (via pressure-sensitive tiles and road coils).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Solar panels</strong> embedded in road dividers and rooftops.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Residual charge</strong> from EVs decelerating or braking.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It also only uses an certain amount of energy that doesnt disappear
        because it gets replaced... its a closed live circuit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the <strong>user-facing experience</strong> (via app or
        public display panels) shows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Live energy levels of each road segment.</li>
        <li>Areas currently "donating" or "receiving" power.</li>
        <li>
          Suggestions for energy-saving routes and optimal times for EV
          charging.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The road even <strong>communicates with emergency services</strong>,
        ensuring that vital energy routes are prioritized — just like arteries
        protecting the heart.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        To the average citizen? Everything appears calm, efficient, and
        uninterrupted. To the designers, engineers, and UX minds behind it? <br>It’s
        the future of <strong>civic infrastructure as a living system.</strong>
