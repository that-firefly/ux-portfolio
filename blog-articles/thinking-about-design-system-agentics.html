  <p>Our current six main interaction states are beginning to morph into something new, omnipresent, adaptive, and
    almost alive. They behave less like static interface conditions and more like living cells: responsive,
    self-regulating, and capable of foreseeing near-future scenarios.</p>

  <p>Traditionally, the <strong>default state</strong> represents the initial landing condition, the moment before
    interaction, when an element is simply seen or sensed. From there, the <strong>focus state</strong> emerges when the
    user intentionally engages, typically by keyboard navigation or clicking into an interactive element.</p>

  <p>The <strong>hover state</strong>, much like focus, signals interactivity through proximity, a user’s pointer
    hovering above a potential action. The <strong>disabled state</strong> communicates temporary dormancy: an element
    that is normally interactive but unavailable at the moment.</p>

  <p>The <strong>pressed state</strong> reflects the liminal moment of intention, between pressing and releasing an
    action, across devices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On a keyboard, after a key is pressed but before it’s released.</li>
    <li>On a mouse, between the click down and the release.</li>
    <li>On touchscreens, from contact until the finger lifts.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This state anticipates an event, embodying the threshold where potential becomes action. Finally, the
    <strong>active state</strong> signifies selection, a persistent acknowledgment that an element is chosen or engaged.
    It is the visible trace of decision, often marked by a highlight, checkmark, or shift in context within menus and
    navigation systems.</p>

  <article class="interaction-evolution">

    <section id="origin">
      <h2>1. Where These Six States Come From</h2>
      <p>These states originate in <strong>Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong> and GUI design systems,
        particularly from the lineage of <strong>WIMP interfaces</strong> (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) developed in
        the 1980s–90s. They reflect a local, bounded interaction loop, a user acting on a discrete element within a
        bounded context (the screen, the app, the window).</p>
      <p>Each state captures a moment in that bounded loop, an event that can be observed, rendered, and resolved. But
        that model assumes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The user is present and focused on a single interface.</li>
        <li>The system is reactive, not proactive.</li>
        <li>Time flows in discrete input–response cycles.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="shift">
      <h2>2. The Shift: Ubiquitous and Agentic Environments</h2>
      <p>In a ubiquitous or ambient computing world, those assumptions collapse. The interface is no longer a window,
        it’s everywhere. The user is no longer bounded, they’re distributed across devices, contexts, and identities.
        The system is no longer passive, it has agency, continuity, and memory.</p>
      <p>So “interaction” stops being a momentary state change on a button, it becomes an ongoing negotiation between
        distributed agents (human and machine) across contexts.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="meta-states">
      <h2>3. Toward New “States” in the Agentic Age</h2>
      <p>If we extend the classic model, we might define meta-states that represent not input conditions but
        <em>relationship conditions</em>, how presence, attention, and intention flow in a continuous field.</p>

      <h3>Here’s one possible expansion:</h3>
      <table class="new-states">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>New State</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Ambient</strong></td>
            <td>The system and user are mutually aware but not in active interaction. Context is sensed, but no direct
              engagement is occurring.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Anticipatory</strong></td>
            <td>The system predicts or infers potential user intent and subtly shifts affordances or prepares responses
              before explicit interaction.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Delegated</strong></td>
            <td>The user has handed partial or full control to an agent; interaction is asynchronous, ambient, or
              representational.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Reconciled</strong></td>
            <td>The system merges asynchronous states (actions, data, context) into a coherent whole, a post-interaction
              synthesis state.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Trans-temporal</strong></td>
            <td>The interaction is not bounded by “now”, it reflects continuity across time and context, e.g., an agent
              acting in your absence, remembering, or adapting.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>These states recognize that interaction is continuous, distributed, and temporally fuzzy.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="time">
      <h2>4. View of Time</h2>
      <p>If we assume that time isn’t real but is a construct of local circumstance, an emergent property of perception,
        then traditional UI “states” are themselves illusions of time.</p>
      <p>The “Pressed” or “Hover” states only make sense when time is linear and causal (<em>event → response → next
          event</em>). But in an agentic temporal framework, interaction is nonlinear, actions ripple across moments,
        and presence can be asynchronous yet immediate.</p>
      <p>So instead of states as frames in time, we might think of <strong>fields of relation</strong>, multidimensional
        conditions of attention, intent, and agency that coexist and overlap.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ontology">
      <h2>5. A New Ontology of Interaction</h2>
      <p>In such an environment, interaction might be modelled not as a timeline, but as an <strong>energy field or
          network of presences</strong>. Each agent (human or synthetic) occupies a vector within that field,
        expressing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attention:</strong> degree of focus or awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>Intention:</strong> goal or purpose projection.</li>
        <li><strong>Agency:</strong> capacity to act autonomously.</li>
        <li><strong>Contextual gravity:</strong> how strongly an environment attracts or modulates behaviour.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The “states” of interaction, then, are configurations of these vectors, dynamic and simultaneous, not
        sequential.</p>
    </section>
  </article>

  <section id="industrial">
    <h2>6. From Industrial Roots to Conscious Systems</h2>
    <p>These interaction states evolved historically from the industrial and cybernetic worldview, where processes were
      standardized and predictable, much like Henry Ford’s assembly lines. Over time, design transitioned from
      mechanical precision to adaptive interaction. This shift mirrors the evolution from <em>industrial control</em> to
      <em>cybernetic feedback</em> and now toward <em>agentic systems</em> that sense, anticipate, and learn.</p>
    <p>In this transformation, consciousness becomes the new user state, awareness as an interactive modality. The
      interface is no longer static but responsive, ecological, and anticipatory.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="slds">
    <h2>7. SLDS 2 and Design Evolution</h2>
    <p>The Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) 2 marks a new phase of this evolution. SLDS 2 uses <strong>CSS
        custom properties</strong> as its visual language, reducing reliance on traditional design tokens. It
      prioritizes <strong>out-of-the-box base Lightning components</strong> over custom blueprints, reflecting a move
      toward consistency and resilience. This architecture is built with <strong>AI-ready components</strong> in mind,
      preparing the foundation for adaptive, intelligent interfaces that integrate seamlessly into agentic systems.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="organisms">
    <h2>8. Design Systems as Living Organisms</h2>
    <p>Modern design systems behave more like living cells, they sense, adapt, and maintain coherence across
      environments. Just as the human immune system reacts to threats and maintains balance, design systems now must
      foresee challenges and self-regulate. They act as ecosystems rather than toolkits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Antigens</strong> – unexpected inputs or contextual changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Antibodies</strong> – adaptive responses via AI or design logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Homeostasis</strong> – maintaining brand, trust, and ethical balance.</li>
      <li><strong>Evolution</strong> – continuous learning from user interaction data.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="sources">
    <h2>9. Key Sources and Theoretical Roots</h2>
    <p>This framework draws from cybernetics, HCI, biomimicry, and posthuman design philosophies, converging into an
      understanding of design as a conscious, adaptive process rather than a static set of rules.</p>
