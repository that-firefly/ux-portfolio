  <h2>Over the past decade, design thinking has been a go-to methodology for innovation: empathy, ideation, iteration.
    But in a world of complexity, interdependence, scale, and speed it’s starting to show its limits.</h2>
  <p>When challenges are tightly constrained, human-centered processes shift and adapt well. But when problems are
    emergent, uncertain, and volatile those same linear cycles often struggle to keep pace.</p>
  <p>We also need to recognise that human behaviour is inherently difficult to predict. Systems built on rigid, binary
    thinking or overly simplified algorithms will almost certainly fall short.</p>
  <p>A well-known example comes from the U.S. housing crisis: some companies used mathematical models to estimate home
    values and assess lending risk, assuming people would behave in stable, rational ways. But human behaviour didn’t
    follow the models. Banks approved loans for people who couldn’t realistically afford them, and when the market
    shifted, many homeowners simply walked away. The algorithms failed because they treated a complex human system as if
    it were predictable and linear and, the real world isn’t.</p>
  <p>But that will be the material for a new <a href="../blog-articles/human-behaviour-is-inherently-difficult-to-predict.html">blog post</a>.</p>
  <h2>So yes, Design thinking revolutionised problem solving by centering empathy, creativity, and iteration, a needed
    counterbalance to purely analytical methods. But the world has evolved. Many of today’s challenges, from global
    supply chains to personalisation at scale, are too dynamic, data-rich, and interconnected, and on the ubiquitous age
    a purely human-centered, linear design process to handle effectively.</h2>
  <p>That’s where data and AI come in. AI helps us sense patterns, model complex systems, and generate insights or solutions built on top of data and human intuition. In a sense, we are moving from Design Thinking to “design sentience”, blending human empathy with computational foresight.</p>
  <p>So while design thinking isn’t “dead,” it’s evolving. The next frontier is augmented sentience: using AI and data not to replace human design, but to expand what’s possible, seeing relationships, predicting outcomes, and testing ideas at a scale and speed never before possible.</p>
  <p>Instead of asking, “What do people need?” we might also ask, “What do the data reveal about unmet needs we can’t yet articulate?” The synergy of human imagination, intuition and experience with machine intelligence is the new design paradigm.</p>
  <h2>I think the next frontier is <i>augmented sentience</i>: combining human insight with data, AI, and systems
    thinking.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data helps us sense hidden patterns, unearth latent needs, and validate ideas faster than ever.</li>
    <li>AI can help us simulate futures, prototype at scale, explore design variants, and even suggest directions we
      hadn’t imagined.</li>
    <li>Blending design thinking and AI isn’t plug-and-play; you need an intentional architecture of methods, values,
      collaboration, and tooling.</li>
    <li>Models such as the <a
        href="https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/beyond-the-double-diamond-ais-challenge-to-design-thinking-eb11a24a2f7c"
        target="_blank"><strong>Stingray Model</strong></a>, which breaks from linear sequence and suggests parallel
      exploration of problem and solution, guided by data/AI signals may start taking over.</li>
    <li>Interconnection and the intersection of systems thinking and design ethics becomes increasingly important: when
      we design a product, service, or framework, it always exists inside an interconnected ecosystem. Every decision
      can ripple outward in ways that are hard to predict, touching “underseen users” (people indirectly affected, but
      rarely considered) and producing second- or third-order consequences — much like a butterfly effect in complex
      adaptive systems.</li>
    <li>The interplay between deterministic and generative responses becomes critical for creating effective products.

  <h2>Main conclusions</h2>
  <p>The interplay between deterministic and generative responses is becoming critical for creating effective products.
  </p>
  <p>Increasingly as systems become more asynchronous and distributed, modern products, particularly those powered by AI
    depend on deterministic and generative processes operating simultaneously.</p>
  <p>Deterministic systems provide reliability, safety, consistency, and predictable outcomes.<br>
    Examples: calculations, validation checks, compliance rules, payment flows.</p>
  <p>Generative systems provide creativity, flexibility, adaptation, and contextual understanding.<br>
    Examples: recommendations, natural-language interfaces, personalised content.
  </p>
  <h3>Why the communication between the two matters?</h3>
  <p>Products now often require a blend of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>structured logic (deterministic)</li>
    <li>adaptive reasoning or creation (generative) in real-time</li>
    <li>and when these two modes inform each other, not operate in isolation, you get systems that are both safe and
      smart, predictable and adaptive.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Examples of this interplay in real products:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chatbots: deterministic rules for safety + generative language for conversation.</li>
    <li>Recommendation systems: deterministic constraints + generative personalisation.</li>
    <li>AI-assisted design tools: deterministic UX patterns + generative creativity.</li>
    <li>Navigation apps: deterministic routing rules + generative traffic predictions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So yes, the relationship and balance between deterministic and generative components is becoming a key design
    principle in modern product development.</p>
