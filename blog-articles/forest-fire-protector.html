        <h1>Forest guard: nature-inspired mushroom fire defense.</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <h3>An innovative concept for an embedded forest mechanism that monitors and protects natural ecosystems automatically.</h3>
        <p>One of my favourite things to do is ideate and imagine bold solutions to real-world problems.
            Recently, I came up with a concept for a device that could be installed in forests and
            automatically <br>activated when a fire is detected nearby. In the coming months, I’ll be
            developing this idea as if it were a real product — exploring its design, UX, and potential
            impact.</p>
            <p>If the idea sparks something in you, feel free to build on it — I’d genuinely love to see it
                come to life. I just ask that you bring me along for the journey and consider collaborating.
                Innovation is always better shared.</p>
            <p> In the heart of vulnerable forests, a bio-inspired sentinel quietly stands watch — the
                Mushroom Guard. This unassuming, mushroom-shaped pole blends naturally into the woodland,
                but it's anything but ordinary. <br>Hidden within its organic silhouette is an advanced fire
                detection and suppression system.</p>

            <p>Equipped with heat sensors and air quality monitors, the Mushroom Guard activates when it
                detects early signs of fire - such as elevated temperatures or smoke — within a 5-meter
                radius. <br>Upon detection, it releases a biodegradable, non-toxic fire-retardant foam designed
                to smother flames before they spread. <br>The foam forms a protective barrier on vegetation,
                reducing the chance of ignition and buying critical time for emergency response teams.</p>

            <p>Silent, sustainable, and smart - the Mushroom Guard represents a new wave of eco-technology
                where design meets environmental resilience.</p>

                alt="Image concept of the user experience of the Mushroom-Shaped Fire Prevention Unit (M-FPU)">

            <h2>Mushroom-Shaped Fire Prevention Unit (M-FPU)</h2>
            <p>The M-FPU is a passive, autonomous fire suppression device designed for early-stage wildfire
                mitigation in forested environments. <br>Its structure mimics the form of a large mushroom to
                blend with natural surroundings while maximizing surface area for sensor arrays and foam
                dispersion.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Key Features</h2>
                    <ul>

                            triggering action when fire signs are within 5 meters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Suppression System:</strong> Releases biodegradable, non-toxic foam to coat
                            vegetation and prevent fire spread.</li>

                    <h2>UX Design Approach</h2>
                    <h3>1. Define the Users</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Primary:</strong> Forest rangers, Environmental scientists, Firefighters,
                            Forestry maintenance workers</li>
                        <li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Conservation organizations, Government fire control
                            agencies, Drone operators</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>2. User Goals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitor M-FPU unit status</li>
                        <li>Receive real-time alerts</li>
                        <li>View unit location and environmental data</li>
                        <li>Coordinate fire risk responses</li>
                        <li>Manage maintenance and refills</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3. Key UX Components</h3>
                    <p>I will be designing these in the following months and gathering your feedback.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dashboard (Web + Mobile):</strong> Map view, environmental data, alerts,
                            maintenance logs, and network status.</li>
                        <li><strong>AR Maintenance Interface:</strong> AR overlays with instructions and
                            diagnostics for field use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drone Integration Console:</strong> Plan refills or inspections; receive
                            video and diagnostics from drones.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>4. UX Principles</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clarity and calm design for emergency use</li>
                        <li>Offline mode support for remote fieldwork</li>
                        <li>Accessible UI with language and contrast options</li>
                        <li>Design reflecting sustainability and harmony with nature</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>5. Journey Example scenario 1</h3>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A forest ranger is alerted to 3 M-FPU units detecting smoke
                        near Ridge Sector B.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Opens app and views heatmap overlay</li>
                        <li>Taps unit ID to check data and history</li>
                        <li>Assigns a drone or plans visit</li>
                        <li>Uses AR in the field to assess and refill canisters</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>6. Journey Example scenario 2</h3>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong>A family enjoying a picnic begins to smell smoke. Moments
                        later, they spot a growing fire nearby, its flames quickly spreading through the trees.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sends an alert to nearby fire authorities and ranger networks.</li>
                        <li>Updates the live dashboard with location, intensity, and deployment status.</li>
                        <li>Triggers nearby Mushroom Guards via mesh network if the fire continues to spread.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
