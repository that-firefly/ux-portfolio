        <h1>Why cybersecurity training is important for UX?</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Cybersecurity training is crucial for UX designers.</h2>

        <h2>Here's why it matters:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>User trust translates into UX reputation</strong><br>
                Good UX builds trust but one security breach destroys it.<br>
                Understanding cybersecurity helps you design experiences to be safe (think: secure login flows, password handling, consent, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Handling sensitive information</strong><br>
                    UX often deals with user data, behaviour patterns, and analytics. <br>If you're unaware of security basics, you might unintentionally design vulnerable interfaces or collect too much.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenges us to ask better questions</strong><br>
                Knowing security basics allows us to collaborate better with developers and stakeholders: <br>
               <i>"Is this cookie policy GDPR compliant?"</i> , <i>"How will users log in and create accounts? Where and how will they reset passwords? <br>At what times of day or year might these actions occur? On which devices and, in which contexts, will these interactions take place, <br>especially in today’s always-connected, multi-platform ubiquitous world?</i>". <br>You become a strategic voice.</li>
            <li><strong>You can design secure-by-design systems</strong><br>
                Cybersecurity training helps you:
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid dark patterns that lead to risky behavior.</li>
                    <li>Design for multi-factor authentication without making it painful.</li>
                    <li>Build with access control and data minimisation in mind.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
             <li><strong>The current landscape is changing fast</strong><br>
                AI, data, decentralisation... all come with new attack vectors. As UX evolves, so must your knowledge of digital safety.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>UX without cybersecurity is like designing a beautiful house and leaving the door unlocked.</h3>
        <p>Even a little training about threat models, secure design patterns, and how to reduce user risk, helps you protect your users, earn their trust, and build better experiences.</p>      
        </ol>
