            <p>At Howden Joinery Group Plc UK in Northampton, the focus was on maintenance and continuous
        improvement to boost visitor traffic <br>on the company’s website and elevate marketing
        campaigns. Working to high standards, the design process utilised a complex and regularly <br>updated design
        system, managed through Abstract - a versioning platform that ensured seamless collaboration
        and consistency.</p>

            <p>The design workflow incorporated industry-standard tools such as Sketch, Figma, Anima, and
        Zeplin, streamlining the design-to-development handoff <br>with accuracy and efficiency. These
        tools were fundamental in maintaining a polished and professional online presence while
        consistently <br>updating and enhancing the website to meet evolving user needs.</p>

            <h3>A Passionate and Collaborative Design Team</h3>
            <p>As part of the Howden Joinery Group Plc digital team, I collaborated with designers,
                marketing
                designers, UX designers, <br>UX researchers, and product designers to ensure the website, apps,
                and trader applications remained accessible, <br>functional, and visually appealing. Our primary
                focus was on user experience, leveraging research insights to drive design decisions <br>and
                foster cross-team collaboration.</p>
            <h3>Design Systems at Howdens</h3>
            <p>The design systems at Howdens were an essential aspect of maintaining quality and consistency
                across all digital assets. <br>Regularly updated with Abstract, it served as the backbone of our
                design process. Working within this system allowed me to gain valuable experience in
                creating, maintaining, <br>and evolving robust design systems that adapt to changing business
                and user requirements.</p>

            <p class="label-text">Abstract is a powerful version control and collaboration platform
                specifically designed for design teams. It streamlines the process of managing design files
                by integrating <br>seamlessly with tools like Sketch and Figma. Designers can create branches,
                make changes, and merge updates without overwriting previous versions, ensuring a
                transparent <br>and organized workflow. Abstract allows teams to collaborate efficiently, review
                design changes, provide feedback, and maintain a complete version history - all in one place.<br>
                This approach enhances consistency, reduces errors, and promotes effective collaboration
                across multidisciplinary teams, making it an essential tool for maintaining complex design
                systems.</p>

            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <p>Our main design tool was Sketch, supported by Anima and Zeplin to ensure precise and
                efficient delivery to the development team. <br>Additionally, we incorporated Figma into our
                workflow for its collaborative features and flexibility. These tools empowered the team to
                maintain <br>high standards while delivering practical and user-centered solutions.</p>
