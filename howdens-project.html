                        <p>At Howden Joinery Group Plc UK in Northampton, the focus was on maintenance and continuous
                            improvement to boost visitor traffic on the companyâ€™s website and elevate marketing
                            campaigns. Working
                            to high standards, the design process utilised a complex and regularly updated design
                            system, managed through Abstract - a versioning platform that ensured seamless collaboration
                            and consistency.</p>

                        <p>The design workflow incorporated industry-standard tools such as Sketch, Figma, Anima, and
                            Zeplin, streamlining the design-to-development handoff with accuracy and efficiency. These
                            tools were fundamental in maintaining a polished and professional online presence while
                            consistently updating and enhancing the website to meet evolving user needs.</p>

                        <h3>A Passionate and Collaborative Design Team</h3>
                        <p>As part of the Howden Joinery Group Plc digital team, I collaborated with designers,
                            marketing
                            designers, UX designers, UX researchers, and product designers to ensure the website, apps,
                            and trader applications remained accessible, functional, and visually appealing. Our primary
                            focus was on user experience, leveraging research insights to drive design decisions and
                            foster cross-team collaboration.</p>
                        <h3>Design Systems at Howdens</h3>
                        <p>The design systems at Howdens were an essential aspect of maintaining quality and consistency
                            across all digital assets. Regularly updated with Abstract, it served as the backbone of our
                            design process. Working within this system allowed me to gain valuable experience in
                            creating, maintaining, and evolving robust design systems that adapt to changing business
                            and user requirements.</p>

                        <p class="label-text">Abstract is a powerful version control and collaboration platform
                            specifically designed for design teams. It streamlines the process of managing design files
                            by integrating seamlessly with tools like Sketch and Figma. Designers can create branches,
                            make changes, and merge updates without overwriting previous versions, ensuring a
                            transparent and organized workflow. Abstract allows teams to collaborate efficiently, review
                            design changes, provide feedback, and maintain a complete version historyâ€”all in one place.
                            This approach enhances consistency, reduces errors, and promotes effective collaboration
                            across multidisciplinary teams, making it an essential tool for maintaining complex design
                            systems.</p>

                        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                        <p>Our main design tool was Sketch, supported by Anima and Zeplin to ensure precise and
                            efficient delivery to the development team. Additionally, we incorporated Figma into our
                            workflow for its collaborative features and flexibility. These tools empowered the team to
                            maintain high standards while delivering practical and user-centered solutions.</p>
