                        <h3>Using AI in my daily UX practice with data visualisation and sentiment analysis.</h3>
                        <p>In my daily UX practice, I utilise tools like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/analyze-sentiment-comprehend">AWS
                            Amazon Comprehend</a> whenever feasible and aligned with business
                            requirements to analyse text in real-time. <br>There are a lot of tools in the market and
                            companies
                            are starting to create similiar ones for internal use too. <br>These tools allow you to extract
                            key
                            phrases,
                            detecting dominant languages, analysing sentiment, and identifying syntax.</p>

                        <p>Amazon Comprehend, powered by AWS, is a Natural
                            Language Processing (NLP) tool that uses machine learning <br>to uncover insights and
                            relationships
                            within text of UTF-8 encoded text documents.</p>
                        <p>For example, starting with an online review, such as one from BT, we can quickly extract key
                            sentiments and insights <br>using Amazon Comprehend, as shown in the several example images.</p>
                        <p>Key insights can be uncovered by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Extracting key phrases.</li>
                            <li>Analysing entity insights.</li>
                            <li>Identifying key sentiments.</li>
                            <li>Gaining insights from targeted sentiment.</li>

                                produces a file

                        <p>This process allows me to use insights quickly, which otherwise would take longer to extract
                            and,
                            apply them to empathy maps <br>and user journey maps, allowing me to understand user challenge
                            and
                            redefine the problem statement further with background, objective data.</p>
                        <p>I can create UX deliverables such as empathy maps, user journeys and graphs to explain the
                            user
                            experience
                            and tell a story (storytelling) easily <br>to stakeholders with reliable background data. Amazon
                            Comprehend
                            allows you to spot factors, key trends and sentiment very quickly but it is still <br>required a
                            human overview                           to discern what is important and irrelevant for a particular project, the storytelling and
                            filter
                            necessary to make <br>sense of information a useful piece of work with value for an
