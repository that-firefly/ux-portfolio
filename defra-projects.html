                        <h3>The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a regulatory
                            framework that holds producers accountable for the environmental impact of their packaging
                            throughout its lifecycle. It incentivises sustainable packaging design, waste
                            reduction, and improved recycling processes by holding producers responsible for the amount
                            and type of packaging they introduce into the market.</h3>

                        <p>Packaging Recovery Notes (PRNs) are evidence-based certificates that businesses
                            can purchase to prove compliance with packaging recycling obligations, ensuring that a
                            corresponding amount of packaging waste is recycled. Materials Facilities play a crucial
                            role in the recycling chain by sorting, processing, and supplying recyclable materials to
                            manufacturers, promoting a circular economy and reducing landfill waste. Together, these
                            systems drive responsible waste management and sustainability in the packaging industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>I began these projects, as always, by gaining a deep understanding of both the business and
                            user needs, as
                            well as the specific problems to be solved. I drew upon existing research and collaborated
                            with stakeholders, while also taking the initiative to apply my user research skills.
                            Drawing
                            from my previous experience, I conducted a lean, quick self-discovery study to identify key
                            areas of focus.</p>
                        <p>To structure my insights, I created my own lean UX canvas, user task maps, user diaries, and
                            empathy maps. Additionally, I developed discovery user flows and journey maps to pinpoint
                            critical micro-moments in the user experience.</p>
                        <p>Created user flow diagrams, empathy maps, user flows with page patterns as per UK Government
                            Digital Service (GDS) Design System, updated online prototypes using the GOV.UK Prototype
                            Kit, GitHub repository
                            and code (nunjucks).</p>

                        <p>My goal was to identify the real users of the service, empathise with their daily
                            experiences,
                            and refine the experience to better meet their needs. Mostly I aimed at serving producers
                            and regulators.</p>

                        <p>Conducted user experience research on platforms such as PowerBI and GOV.UK web pages web
                            applications to understand producers and regulators' behaviour, main objectives, and tasks.
                        </p>
                        <p>I also created user task diagrams and data maps to provide me with a clear visualisation of
                            data
                            flow and its interconnections with user objectives and tasks, ensuring better alignment and
                            understanding. I have used artificial intelligence from Evidenâ€™s internal platform to assist
                            me with this task.</p>
