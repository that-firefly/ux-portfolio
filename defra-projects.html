        <h2>About the project(s)</h2>
        <h3>The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a regulatory
            framework that holds producers accountable<br> for the environmental impact of their packaging
            throughout its lifecycle. It incentivises sustainable packaging design, <br>waste
            reduction, and improved recycling processes by holding producers responsible for the amount
            and type of packaging they introduce into the market.</h3>

        <p>Packaging Recovery Notes (PRNs) are evidence-based certificates that businesses
            can purchase to prove compliance with packaging recycling obligations, <br>ensuring that a
            corresponding amount of packaging waste is recycled. Materials Facilities play a crucial
            role in the recycling chain by sorting, processing, <br>and supplying recyclable materials to
            manufacturers, promoting a circular economy and reducing landfill waste. <br>Together, these
            systems drive responsible waste management and sustainability in the packaging industry.
        </p>
        <p>I began these projects, as always, by gaining a deep understanding of both the business and
            user needs, as well as the specific problems to be solved. <br>I drew upon existing research and collaborated
            with stakeholders, while also taking the initiative to apply my user research skills.<br>
            Drawing from my previous experience, I conducted a lean, quick self-discovery study to identify key
            areas of focus.</p>
        <p>To structure my insights, I created my own lean UX canvas, user task maps, user diaries, and
            empathy maps. <br>Additionally, I developed discovery user flows and journey maps to pinpoint
            critical micro-moments in the user experience.</p>
        <p>Created user flow diagrams, empathy maps, user flows with page patterns as per UK Government
            Digital Service (GDS) Design System, <br>updated online prototypes using the GOV.UK Prototype
            Kit, GitHub repository
            and code (nunjucks).</p>

        <p>My goal was to identify the real users of the service, empathise with their daily
            experiences, and refine the experience to better meet their needs. <br>Mostly I aimed at serving producers
            and regulators.</p>

        <p>Conducted user experience research on platforms such as PowerBI and GOV.UK web pages web
            applications to understand producers and regulators' behaviour, main objectives, and tasks.
        </p>
        <p>I also created user task diagrams and data maps to provide me with a clear visualisation of
            data flow and its interconnections with user objectives and tasks, ensuring better alignment<br> and
            understanding. I have used artificial intelligence from Eviden’s internal platform to assist
            me with this task.</p>

        <p>I analysed previous documentation, user interviews, and workshops to identify user emotions,
            challenges, and opportunities for improvement <br>across platforms and standards. My focus was
            on enhancing the overall user experience by creating a seamless and holistic journey,
            aligning with an omnichannel objective.</p>
