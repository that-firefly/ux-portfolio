                        <h3>Groundbreaking platform to streamline heating oil readings, orders, and deliveries.</h3>
                        <p>BoilerJuice is the UK's leading heating oil supplier, providing a simple, efficient, and
                            cost-effective way for customers to order heating oil. Established in 2004, BoilerJuice
                            revolutionised the industry by offering a price comparison service that allows users to find
                            the best local deals on heating oil. With its focus on customer satisfaction, BoilerJuice
                            has built a reputation for offering competitive prices, reliable delivery, and a seamless
                            online experience. The company operates through an extensive network of trusted heating oil
                            suppliers, ensuring that customers receive fast and reliable delivery, no matter where they
                            are. In addition to offering single heating oil deliveries, BoilerJuice provides
                            subscription services for those who prefer the convenience of automatic top-ups, saving both
                            time and effort. Their innovative approach and dedication to customer care make BoilerJuice
                            the go-to platform for heating oil orders across the UK.</p>

                        <p>BoilerJuice, founded in 2004, revolutionised the heating oil market by offering a comparison
                            website that helped users save money by finding local, cheaper prices and facilitating oil
                            deliveries. However, as demand grew, the traditional customer journeyâ€”relying on phone
                            orders and a basic online formâ€”became outdated and inefficient. Customers often faced
                            delays, risking running out of heating oil, particularly in winter months, while the
                            customer service team struggled to manage the increasing volume of orders. Customers also
                            had to physically check oil levels, which was inconvenient, especially during cold weather.
                            The lack of real-time updates and limited online interaction led to frustration, service
                            abandonment, and loss of potential customers.</p>
