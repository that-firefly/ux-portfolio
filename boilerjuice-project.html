     <h1>BoilerJuice UX Case Study - Heating oil supply</h1>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>BoilerJuice is the UK's leading heating oil supplier, providing a simple, efficient, and
            cost-effective way for customers to order heating oil. <br>Established in 2004, BoilerJuice
            revolutionised the industry by offering a price comparison service that allows users to find
            the best local deals <br>on heating oil.</p>
        
        <p>BoilerJuice, founded in 2004, revolutionised the heating oil market by offering a comparison
            website that helped users save money by finding local, <br>cheaper prices and facilitating oil
            deliveries. However, as demand grew, the traditional customer journey (relying on phone
            orders and a basic online form)<br> became outdated and inefficient.</p>

        <p><strong>With its focus on customer satisfaction, BoilerJuice
            has built a reputation for offering competitive prices, reliable delivery, and a seamless<br>
            online experience. The company operates through an extensive network of trusted heating oil
            suppliers, ensuring that customers receive fast <br>and reliable delivery, no matter where they
            are.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Due to their growing popularity and the seasonal surge in orders during winter, BoilerJuice faced challenges in maintaining customer satisfaction. 
            <br>A key issue was the lack of a fast, real-time heating oil level monitoring system. Customers often discovered their tank levels were already <br>
            critically low by the time they placed an order, leaving them without heating, particularly in remote locations such as countryside cottages.
            <br>On top of that, the ordering process was cumbersome.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Customers had to manually search for the best quote, place their order, and then call customer service to confirm and receive delivery updates. 
                <br>This not only placed significant strain on the customer service team and increased operational costs, but also risked losing clients to competitors, 
                <br>as many did not want to wait in lengthy call queues.</p>

        <p>Customers also
            had to physically check oil levels, which was inconvenient, especially during cold weather.<br>
            The lack of real-time updates and limited online interaction led to frustration, service
            abandonment, and loss of potential customers.</p>

        <section class="challenge">
  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    Customers needed a fast, friction-free way to understand pricing and options and place a heating-oil order.
    <br>Many also had to go outside to read their tank gauges, unpleasant in winter and impractical for customers with mobility constraints.<br>
    <br>The existing website, calculator, and service showed the following issues:
  </p>

  <div class="pain-points">
    <div class="card">Cluttered layout and weak content hierarchy, making key actions hard to find.</div>
    <div class="card">A long, single-column form that was difficult to access on mobile; critical fields slipped below the fold or under the keyboard.</div>
    <div class="card">Inconsistent responsive behavior across devices; key tasks (get a quote, order, reorder, track delivery) were unreliable on phones and desktops.</div>
    <div class="card">Accessibility gaps (contrast, focus states, labels, keyboard navigation, screen-reader support) that made the journey harder for older adults and people with disabilities.</div>
    <div class="card">Forced account creation before value was demonstrated; no clear guest checkout or clear “save my quote” path.</div>
    <div class="card">Authentication and account-management problems (login loops, password reset failures, unclear error states).</div>
    <div class="card">Fragmented end-to-end flow—from quote to checkout to delivery—causing drop-offs, abandoned orders, lower trust in the platform and unnecessary support calls.</div>
    <div class="card">Limited order status visibility; no proactive notifications, live ETAs, or delivery-window selection.</div>
    <div class="card">Over-reliance on phone support; no real alternative channels such as email, SMS, or WhatsApp for alerts and updates.</div>
    <div class="card">Progress not preserved when switching devices; forms sometimes hid fields on small screens.</div>
  </div>

    <img style="width:1200px; height:auto;" src="./images/boilerjuice/cluttered-website.png" alt="BoilerJuice challenges cluttered website"
            title="BoilerJuice challenges from the old platform such as cluttered website.">

   <div class="pain-points">
    <div class="card">No real-time tank-level input or smart gauge integration, increasing the risk of running out in cold weather.</div>
    <div class="card">Pricing opacity: unclear fees, taxes, minimum order quantities, and postcode-based pricing changes.</div>
    <div class="card">No budget or payment options (e.g., monthly plans, subscriptions, instalments, or AutoPay).</div>
    <div class="card">Weak reorder tools: no order history, favourites, or one-tap “repeat last order.”</div>
    <div class="card">Poor address and service-area validation; users could progress only to learn delivery wasn’t available.</div>
    <div class="card">Missing delivery preferences (safe-fill limit, access notes, gate codes, pets, parking/driveway constraints).</div>
    <div class="card">Limited support for multiple tanks, tank-size selection, and safe-capacity calculations.</div>
    <div class="card">Performance issues on slower rural connections; timeouts during peak demand or severe weather.</div>
    <div class="card">Trust and compliance signals were missing or buried (safety credentials, insurance, environmental commitments, GDPR/privacy).</div>
    <div class="card">Inconsistent terminology and units (litres vs. gallons), confusing price and quantity expectations.</div>
    <div class="card">Content relied on jargon and lacked reassurance, especially for winter or emergency scenarios.</div>
  </div>

  <h2>These issues led to an increase of support calls, abandoned orders, and lower trust in the platform.</h2>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p></p>



















        <p>To address these challenges, BoilerJuice introduced an innovative new platform that connects
            live heating oil readings from smart <br>tanks directly to the online system. This platform
            provides users with accurate, up-to-date oil levels, automatically generating the best<br>
            quotes from a range of suppliers and pairing users with the most cost-effective option. Customers can now place orders online, track delivery <br>
            progress in real time, and save money
            through smarter decision-making. By redesigning the customer experience journey and
            listening to user feedback,<br> BoilerJuice significantly improved service transparency and
            customer satisfaction while reducing pressure on support teams. <br>As a result, the new
            platform not only promotes customer loyalty but also attracts new users by offering a
            seamless, efficient, and user-friendly experience.</p>

        <p>The result was a completely redesigned platform that connected live heating oil readings from
            smart tanks directly to the BoilerJuice website, mobile, and app. <br>The new system sends
            alerts to customers when their oil levels are low, prompting them to place an order. It also
            allows them to get more precise quotes <br>and purchase heating oil directly online, or even
            subscribe to an automatic refill service. This solution was convenient, accessible, and
            offered competitive prices, <br>ensuring customer trust and making the process more transparent.
        </p>

        <p>Through this comprehensive approach, BoilerJuice successfully created a new platform that not
            only solved critical customer pain points <br>but also improved the overall experience by
            providing a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly service.</p>

                alt="BoilerJuice homepage" title="Current homepage of BoilerJuice">Boilerjuice Ltd.</a>

        <p>To address these issues, we took a Design Thinking approach to redesign the entire customer
            experience. We started by researching pain points, analysing opportunities<br>on the web
            platform, and examining both front-stage and back-stage services. This research involved
            collaborating with users (both new and returning), heating oil suppliers,<br> engineers,
            customer service teams, web developers, and data analysts. Our goal was to create a
            personalised, seamless journey for customers and improve the mobile experience.</p>
         
        <p>We utilised tools such as Google Analytics, Google Optimize for A/B testing, and Lucky Orange
            to gain emotional insights. <br>For journey mapping, we used Sketch and Smaply, among others.
            Jira was used for project tracking and collaboration, especially as we worked <br>with a large
            team of specialists. Throughout the project, we produced various deliverables, including
            ecosystem maps, persona profiles, user journeys,<br> emotion maps, wireframes, and prototypes,
            all of which were tested regularly. We conducted interviews, workshops, and continuous
            meetings with the client <br>to present discovery outcomes, advise on solutions, and outline
            next steps.</p>
