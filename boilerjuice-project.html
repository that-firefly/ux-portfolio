    <h1>BoilerJuice UX Case Study - Heating oil supply</h1>


    <div class="section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>BoilerJuice is the UK's leading heating oil supplier, providing a simple, efficient, and
        cost-effective way for customers to order heating oil. <br>Established in 2004, BoilerJuice
        revolutionised the industry by offering a price comparison service that allows users to find
        the best local deals <br>on heating oil.</p>

      <p>BoilerJuice, founded in 2004, revolutionised the heating oil market by offering a comparison
        website that helped users save money by finding local, <br>cheaper prices and facilitating oil
        deliveries. However, as demand grew, the traditional customer journey (relying on phone
        orders and a basic online form)<br> became outdated and inefficient.</p>

      <p><strong>With its focus on customer satisfaction, BoilerJuice
          has built a reputation for offering competitive prices, reliable delivery, and a seamless<br>
          online experience. The company operates through an extensive network of trusted heating oil
          suppliers, ensuring that customers receive fast <br>and reliable delivery, no matter where they
          are.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Due to their growing popularity and the seasonal surge in orders during winter, BoilerJuice faced
          challenges in maintaining customer satisfaction.
          <br>A key issue was the lack of a fast, real-time heating oil level monitoring system. Customers often
          discovered their tank levels were already <br>
          critically low by the time they placed an order, leaving them without heating, particularly in remote
          locations such as countryside cottages.
          <br>On top of that, the ordering process was cumbersome.</strong></p>

      <p>Customers had to manually search for the best quote, place their order, and then call customer service to
        confirm and receive delivery updates.
        <br>This not only placed significant strain on the customer service team and increased operational costs, but
        also risked losing clients to competitors,
        <br>as many did not want to wait in lengthy call queues.
      </p>

      <p>Customers also
        had to physically check oil levels, which was inconvenient, especially during cold weather.<br>
        The lack of real-time updates and limited online interaction led to frustration, service
        abandonment, and loss of potential customers.</p>

      <section class="challenge">
        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Customers needed a fast, friction-free way to understand pricing and options and place a heating-oil order.
          <br>Many also had to go outside to read their tank gauges, unpleasant in winter and impractical for customers
          with mobility constraints.<br>
          <br>The existing website, calculator, and service showed the following issues:
        </p>

        <div class="pain-points">
          <p>Some of the pain points found:</p>
          <div class="pain-points-card">Cluttered layout and weak content hierarchy, making key actions hard to find.
          </div>
          <div class="pain-points-card">A long, single-column form that was difficult to access on mobile; critical
            fields slipped below the fold or under the keyboard.</div>
          <div class="pain-points-card">Inconsistent responsive behavior across devices; key tasks (get a quote, order,
            reorder, track delivery) were unreliable on phones and desktops.</div>
          <div class="pain-points-card">Accessibility gaps (contrast, focus states, labels, keyboard navigation,
            screen-reader support) that made the journey harder for older adults and people with disabilities.</div>
          <div class="pain-points-card">Forced account creation before value was demonstrated; no clear guest checkout
            or clear “save my quote” path.</div>
          <div class="pain-points-card">Authentication and account-management problems (login loops, password reset
            failures, unclear error states).</div>
          <div class="pain-points-card">Fragmented end-to-end flow—from quote to checkout to delivery—causing drop-offs,
            abandoned orders, lower trust in the platform and unnecessary support calls.</div>
          <div class="pain-points-card">Limited order status visibility; no proactive notifications, live ETAs, or
            delivery-window selection.</div>
          <div class="pain-points-card">Over-reliance on phone support; no real alternative channels such as email, SMS,
            or WhatsApp for alerts and updates.</div>
          <div class="pain-points-card">Progress not preserved when switching devices; forms sometimes hid fields on
            small screens.</div>
        </div>

      <h2>My role</h2>
      <img class="img-xs" src="./images/boilerjuice/ux-designer-estela.png" alt="Estela UX Designer"
        title="Image of Estela UX Designer.">
      <p>Over ~18 months, I held ~80% UX ownership in a 300-person cross-functional team.
        <br>We used Confluence, Google Analytics, and optimised the web experience across Chrome, IE, Firefox, Opera,
        and Safari.
        <br>The team included product owners, engineers, customer service specialists, heating oil partners, marketing
        professionals, and developers,
        <br>altogether involving around 300 people. We collaborated using platforms such as Confluence and Google
        Analytics, and designed for web
        <br>environments optimised for Chrome and Internet Explorer, while also ensuring compatibility with Firefox,
        Opera, and Safari.
      </p>
      <p>Designed and launched a new service that makes buying heating oil as effortless as being connected to a mains
        supply.
        <br>This included creating new user journeys, redesigning legacy pages, and building fresh content for the
        Connected Service
        <br>across the company’s public website (www.boilerjuice.com) and mobile app.
      </p>

    
      <div class="role">
          <p>Some of my tasks:</p>
        <div class="card">UI Designer (User Interface Design).</div>
        <div class="card">Conducted user research in collaboration with the Product Owner.</div>
        <div class="card">Collaborated with Product Owner, Engineers, Customer Service, Heating Oil Companies, Data
          Analysts, and Developers.</div>
        <div class="card">Delivered user research insights, ecosystem maps, blueprint canvases, lean canvases, user
          flows with UX diaries, <br>and information architecture maps in collaboration with Engineers and the Product
          Owner.</div>
        <div class="card">Produced wireframes and interactive prototypes with Axure and Figma.</div>
        <div class="card">Created and maintained a design system with detailed interaction specifications using
          InVision.</div>
        <div class="card">Worked with the marketing team to create digital marketing materials.</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Process &amp; Approach</h2>
      <h2 class="case-section">1 – Business research and discovery</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Organised a series of meetings and workshops with stakeholders, customer service teams, product managers,
          <br>and developers to understand both what was working well and what was not, as well as to gain clarity on
          the <br>new offering - the Connected Service.
        </li>
        <li>During this process, I used sketches and the Lean Canvas framework to quickly capture current problems,
          <br>business goals, value propositions, and success metrics, with the aim of achieving a market-fit product.
        </li>
        <li>Identified key user groups (including adults over 40 and stay-at-home parents) to map personas and capture
          diverse needs.</li>
        <li>Identified the key problems, opportunities, and challenges, focusing in particular on the main blockers
          <br>and customer pain points within the journey, as well as patterns in returning-user behaviour.
        </li>
        <li>Assessed how the new Connected Service might compare with the competition, and whether it could deliver
          <br>advantages by meeting the underserved needs of users in the current market.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Tasks and deliverables produced during this phase:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Held initial meetings with BoilerJuice stakeholders to gather their perspectives on potential problems and
          created a Lean Canvas to document and organise insights.</li>
        <li>Analysed customer feedback and support tickets to identify common pain points and recurring issues.</li>
        <li>Ran recurring in-depth interviews with at least 10 customers per week over several months, ensuring
          consistent feedback, ensuring representation from diverse UK regions including East Midlands, West Midlands,
          Yorkshire and Humber, North West, North East, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.</li>
        <li>Reviewed and extracted Google Analytics data to pinpoint drop-off points in the user experience, mapping
          them into detailed user flows and breaking the journey down into key micro-interactions.</li>
        <li>Created empathy maps to visualise user needs (pain points and opportunities), emotions, and behaviours at
          different stages of the journey.</li>
        <li>Benchmarked competitor experiences to identify best practices and gaps in the market.</li>
        <li>Mapped ecosystem diagrams to show how the product interacts with other systems and stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Conducted a comprehensive as-is audit of the current website, mobile experience, and app, supplemented by a
          detailed competitive analysis.</li>
        <li>Facilitated a stakeholder workshop to align on goals, define success criteria, and prioritise key problem
          areas for design and research focus.</li>

      <h2 class="case-section">2 - Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mapped user flows in Draw.io and Sketch, capturing both ‘happy’ and ‘unhappy’ paths to anticipate <br>and
          address potential issues early in the design process.</li>
        <li>Created low- to mid-fidelity interactive wireframes in Axure, Sketch, Figma, and Balsamiq <br>for
          stakeholder review, ensuring a shared understanding of functionality and flow.</li>
        <li>Applied consistent iconography and clear, accessible headings to support usability.</li>
        <li>Redesigned the quote form to provide faster, clearer heating-oil quotes, while also enabling the
          <br>promotion and sale of a heating-oil subscription service.
        </li>
        <li>Focused on improving the end-to-end purchasing experience for heating oil. I redesigned key pages <br>in the
          checkout journey, including product selection, shopping cart,
          payment, and the final confirmation page, <br>to ensure a smoother, more transparent, and mobile-friendly
          process.
          The goal was to reduce friction, increase <br>trust at each step, and provide clear reassurance after
          purchase.</li>
        <li>Refined marketing propositions, placing them more strategically on the page and removing visual clutter to
          improve clarity and focus.</li>
        <li>Implemented consistent iconography and clear headings.</li>
        <li>Added an improved search function for faster access to key documents and data.</li>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>BoilerJuice was a growing oil marketplace, but customers often found the ordering process clunky, price
        comparisons confusing, and overall trust low.
        <br>In winter, heating oil deliveries could take one to two weeks, and many families were left without heating
        because the time-consuming process of requesting quotes, making payments, and arranging deliveries created
        delays.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase in self-serve ordering; CS calls shifted toward proactive follow-ups rather than winter
          emergencies.</li>
        <li>Faster quote-to-order and clearer delivery expectations, improving perceived reliability.</li>
        <li>Higher repeat usage via alerts and subscription options, strengthening loyalty.</li>
        <li>Operational resilience during peak demand due to earlier reordering and better transparency.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="outcomes">
        <p>But after UX improvements:</p>
        <div class="outcomes-card">Simplified the order flow → reduced drop-off.</div>
        <div class="outcomes-card">Clearer price transparency → increased trust + conversions.</div>

        <div class="outcomes-card">Created new quote-generation screens → made pricing clearer and ordering faster,
          while highlighting potential issues up front, which not only reduced customer stress but also improved the
          quality of interactions with the support team.</div>
        <div class="outcomes-card">Collaborated in the creation of a new service, the Connected Service, a
          subscription-style model that makes buying heating oil feel as effortless as being on mains. → This
          subscription-style model transformed the experience of buying heating oil into a seamless process.</div>
        <div class="outcomes-card">Redesigned client dashboards to integrate data from a new tank device → providing
          customers with automatic usage readings, alerts, and clear guidelines.</div>
        <div class="outcomes-card">Omnichannel redesign → consistent, uninterrupted experience across devices and
          platforms.</div>
        <div class="outcomes-card">Peak-season resilience → support pressure reduced; calls shifted from winter

      <h2>My contribution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible, mobile-first redesign:</strong> Reworked information architecture, forms, error states,
          and contrast to make the experience clearer and more inclusive across web, mobile, and app.</li>
        <li><strong>Quote &amp; checkout clarity:</strong> Designed new quote-generation screens and simplified
          steps/copy to reduce friction and decision fatigue.</li>
        <li><strong>Connected Service (subscription-style):</strong> Co-created and redesigned the proposition and
          end-to-end flows so buying oil felt as effortless as a mains connection.</li>
        <li><strong>IoT-enabled dashboards:</strong> Redesigned account areas to ingest smart-tank readings; introduced
          low-level alerts, usage trends, refill guidance, and exception handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Proactive issue surfacing:</strong> Embedded warnings and guidance earlier in the journey, improving
          first-time resolution and the quality of CS interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Omnichannel orchestration:</strong> Established shared patterns and components for a consistent,
          uninterrupted experience across channels and devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence-driven iteration:</strong> Led discovery and validation (interviews, journey mapping,
          analytics, A/B tests), prioritising a roadmap that balanced user value with operational feasibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery partnership:</strong> Worked closely with engineers on specs, edge cases, and QA/UAT to
          de-risk implementation and speed up release cycles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p> Connecting live tank data to the digital journey transformed heating oil buying from a reactive, last-minute
        scramble into a proactive,
        <br>planned experience. Real-time levels, clearer quotes, and tracked deliveries increased trust and pushed more
        customers toward self-serve
        <br>behaviours. The omnichannel, accessible redesign reduced seasonal pressure on support, shifted conversations
        from emergencies to follow-ups,
        <br>and created a foundation for retention through alerts and subscription-style ordering. In short: less panic,
        more planning—and a service that finally felt as reliable as a utility.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time data &amp; alerts made usage visible and actionable, reducing winter stress and stockouts.</li>
        <li>Price transparency and a streamlined quote-to-order flow improved confidence and conversion.</li>
        <li>Omnichannel consistency + accessibility widened reach and simplified repeat ordering.</li>
        <li>Cross-functional delivery (engineering, CS, suppliers) turned UX changes into service innovation.</li>
      </ul>
