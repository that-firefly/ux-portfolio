        <h2>About the project(s)</h2>
        <h3>Innovative heating oil platform with integrated smart reading technology.</h3>

            cost-effective way for customers to order heating oil. <br>Established in 2004, BoilerJuice

            are. <br>In addition to offering single heating oil deliveries, BoilerJuice provides

        </p>

        <p>BoilerJuice, founded in 2004, revolutionised the heating oil market by offering a comparison
            website that helped users save money by finding local, <br>cheaper prices and facilitating oil
            deliveries. However, as demand grew, the traditional customer journey (relying on phone
            orders and a basic online form)<br> became outdated and inefficient. Customers often faced
            delays, risking running out of heating oil, particularly in winter months, while the
            customer service team <br>struggled to manage the increasing volume of orders.</p>

        <p>Customers also
            had to physically check oil levels, which was inconvenient, especially during cold weather.<br>
            The lack of real-time updates and limited online interaction led to frustration, service
            abandonment, and loss of potential customers.</p>

        <p>To address these challenges, BoilerJuice introduced an innovative new platform that connects
            live heating oil readings from smart <br>tanks directly to the online system. This platform
            provides users with accurate, up-to-date oil levels, automatically generating the best<br>
            quotes from a range of suppliers and pairing users with the most cost-effective option. Customers can now place orders online, track delivery <br>
            progress in real time, and save money
            through smarter decision-making. By redesigning the customer experience journey and
            listening to user feedback,<br> BoilerJuice significantly improved service transparency and
            customer satisfaction while reducing pressure on support teams. <br>As a result, the new
            platform not only promotes customer loyalty but also attracts new users by offering a
            seamless, efficient, and user-friendly experience.</p>

        <p>The result was a completely redesigned platform that connected live heating oil readings from
            smart tanks directly to the BoilerJuice website, mobile, and app. <br>The new system sends
            alerts to customers when their oil levels are low, prompting them to place an order. It also
            allows them to get more precise quotes <br>and purchase heating oil directly online, or even
            subscribe to an automatic refill service. This solution was convenient, accessible, and
            offered competitive prices, <br>ensuring customer trust and making the process more transparent.
        </p>

        <p>Through this comprehensive approach, BoilerJuice successfully created a new platform that not
            only solved critical customer pain points <br>but also improved the overall experience by
            providing a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly service.</p>

        <p>To address these issues, we took a Design Thinking approach to redesign the entire customer
            experience. We started by researching pain points, analysing opportunities<br>on the web
            platform, and examining both front-stage and back-stage services. This research involved
            collaborating with users (both new and returning), heating oil suppliers,<br> engineers,
            customer service teams, web developers, and data analysts. Our goal was to create a
            personalised, seamless journey for customers and improve the mobile experience.</p>

        <p class="label-text">Examples of service design, user research, user experience, and user
            interface design processes.</p>
        <p>We utilised tools such as Google Analytics, Google Optimize for A/B testing, and Lucky Orange
            to gain emotional insights. <br>For journey mapping, we used Sketch and Smaply, among others.
            Jira was used for project tracking and collaboration, especially as we worked <br>with a large
            team of specialists. Throughout the project, we produced various deliverables, including
            ecosystem maps, persona profiles, user journeys,<br> emotion maps, wireframes, and prototypes,
            all of which were tested regularly. We conducted interviews, workshops, and continuous
            meetings with the client <br>to present discovery outcomes, advise on solutions, and outline
            next steps.</p>
