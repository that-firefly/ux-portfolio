                        <h3>Innovative heating oil platform with integrated smart reading technology.</h3>
                        <p>BoilerJuice is the UK's leading heating oil supplier, providing a simple, efficient, and
                            cost-effective way for customers to order heating oil. Established in 2004, BoilerJuice
                            revolutionised the industry by offering a price comparison service that allows users to find
                            the best local deals on heating oil. With its focus on customer satisfaction, BoilerJuice
                            has built a reputation for offering competitive prices, reliable delivery, and a seamless
                            online experience.</p>

                        <p>The company operates through an extensive network of trusted heating oil
                            suppliers, ensuring that customers receive fast and reliable delivery, no matter where they
                            are. In addition to offering single heating oil deliveries, BoilerJuice provides
                            subscription services for those who prefer the convenience of automatic top-ups, saving both
                            time and effort. Their innovative approach and dedication to customer care make BoilerJuice
                            the go-to platform for heating oil orders across the UK.</p>

                        </p>

                        <p>BoilerJuice, founded in 2004, revolutionised the heating oil market by offering a comparison
                            website that helped users save money by finding local, cheaper prices and facilitating oil
                            deliveries. However, as demand grew, the traditional customer journey - relying on phone
                            orders and a basic online form - became outdated and inefficient. Customers often faced
                            delays, risking running out of heating oil, particularly in winter months, while the
                            customer service team struggled to manage the increasing volume of orders.</p>

                        <p>Customers also
                            had to physically check oil levels, which was inconvenient, especially during cold weather.
                            The lack of real-time updates and limited online interaction led to frustration, service
                            abandonment, and loss of potential customers.</p>

                        <p class="label-text">Heating oil truck image generated by ChatGPT.</p>

                        <p>To address these challenges, BoilerJuice introduced an innovative new platform that connects
                            live heating oil readings from smart tanks directly to the online system. This platform
                            provides users with accurate, up-to-date oil levels, automatically generating the best
                            quotes from a range of suppliers and pairing users with the most cost-effective option.
                            Customers can now place orders online, track delivery progress in real time, and save money
                            through smarter decision-making. By redesigning the customer experience journey and
                            listening to user feedback, BoilerJuice significantly improved service transparency and
                            customer satisfaction while reducing pressure on support teams. As a result, the new
                            platform not only promotes customer loyalty but also attracts new users by offering a
                            seamless, efficient, and user-friendly experience.</p>

                        <p>The result was a completely redesigned platform that connected live heating oil readings from
                            smart tanks directly to the BoilerJuice website, mobile, and app. The new system sends
                            alerts to customers when their oil levels are low, prompting them to place an order. It also
                            allows them to get more precise quotes and purchase heating oil directly online, or even
                            subscribe to an automatic refill service. This solution was convenient, accessible, and
                            offered competitive prices, ensuring customer trust and making the process more transparent.
                        </p>

                        <p>Through this comprehensive approach, BoilerJuice successfully created a new platform that not
                            only solved critical customer pain points but also improved the overall experience by
                            providing a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly service.</p>

                        <p>To address these issues, we took a Design Thinking approach to redesign the entire customer
                            experience. We started by researching pain points, analysing opportunities on the web
                            platform, and examining both front-stage and back-stage services. This research involved
                            collaborating with users (both new and returning), heating oil suppliers, engineers,
                            customer service teams, web developers, and data analysts. Our goal was to create a
                            personalised, seamless journey for customers and improve the mobile experience.</p>

                            interface design processes.</p>
                        <p>We utilised tools such as Google Analytics, Google Optimize for A/B testing, and Lucky Orange
                            to gain emotional insights. For journey mapping, we used Sketch and Smaply, among others.
                            Jira was used for project tracking and collaboration, especially as we worked with a large
                            team of specialists. Throughout the project, we produced various deliverables, including
                            ecosystem maps, persona profiles, user journeys, emotion maps, wireframes, and prototypes,
                            all of which were tested regularly. We conducted interviews, workshops, and continuous
                            meetings with the client to present discovery outcomes, advise on solutions, and outline
                            next steps.</p>
