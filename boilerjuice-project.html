     <h1>BoilerJuice UX Case Study - Heating oil supply</h1>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>BoilerJuice is the UK's leading heating oil supplier, providing a simple, efficient, and
            cost-effective way for customers to order heating oil. <br>Established in 2004, BoilerJuice
            revolutionised the industry by offering a price comparison service that allows users to find
            the best local deals <br>on heating oil.</p>
        
        <p>BoilerJuice, founded in 2004, revolutionised the heating oil market by offering a comparison
            website that helped users save money by finding local, <br>cheaper prices and facilitating oil
            deliveries. However, as demand grew, the traditional customer journey (relying on phone
            orders and a basic online form)<br> became outdated and inefficient.</p>

        <p><strong>With its focus on customer satisfaction, BoilerJuice
            has built a reputation for offering competitive prices, reliable delivery, and a seamless<br>
            online experience. The company operates through an extensive network of trusted heating oil
            suppliers, ensuring that customers receive fast <br>and reliable delivery, no matter where they
            are.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Due to their growing popularity and the seasonal surge in orders during winter, BoilerJuice faced challenges in maintaining customer satisfaction. 
            <br>A key issue was the lack of a fast, real-time heating oil level monitoring system. Customers often discovered their tank levels were already <br>
            critically low by the time they placed an order, leaving them without heating, particularly in remote locations such as countryside cottages.
            <br>On top of that, the ordering process was cumbersome.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Customers had to manually search for the best quote, place their order, and then call customer service to confirm and receive delivery updates. 
                <br>This not only placed significant strain on the customer service team and increased operational costs, but also risked losing clients to competitors, 
                <br>as many did not want to wait in lengthy call queues.</p>

        <p>Customers also
            had to physically check oil levels, which was inconvenient, especially during cold weather.<br>
            The lack of real-time updates and limited online interaction led to frustration, service
            abandonment, and loss of potential customers.</p>

        <section class="challenge">
  <h2>The challenge</h2>
  <p>
    Customers needed a fast, friction-free way to understand pricing and options and place a heating-oil order.
    <br>Many also had to go outside to read their tank gauges, unpleasant in winter and impractical for customers with mobility constraints.<br>
    <br>The existing website, calculator, and service showed the following issues:
  </p>

  <div class="pain-points">
    <div class="card">Cluttered layout and weak content hierarchy, making key actions hard to find.</div>
    <div class="card">A long, single-column form that was difficult to access on mobile; critical fields slipped below the fold or under the keyboard.</div>
    <div class="card">Inconsistent responsive behavior across devices; key tasks (get a quote, order, reorder, track delivery) were unreliable on phones and desktops.</div>
    <div class="card">Accessibility gaps (contrast, focus states, labels, keyboard navigation, screen-reader support) that made the journey harder for older adults and people with disabilities.</div>
    <div class="card">Forced account creation before value was demonstrated; no clear guest checkout or clear “save my quote” path.</div>
    <div class="card">Authentication and account-management problems (login loops, password reset failures, unclear error states).</div>
    <div class="card">Fragmented end-to-end flow—from quote to checkout to delivery—causing drop-offs, abandoned orders, lower trust in the platform and unnecessary support calls.</div>
    <div class="card">Limited order status visibility; no proactive notifications, live ETAs, or delivery-window selection.</div>
    <div class="card">Over-reliance on phone support; no real alternative channels such as email, SMS, or WhatsApp for alerts and updates.</div>
    <div class="card">Progress not preserved when switching devices; forms sometimes hid fields on small screens.</div>
  </div>

    <img style="width:1200px; height:auto;" src="./images/boilerjuice/cluttered-website.png" alt="BoilerJuice challenges cluttered website"
            title="BoilerJuice challenges from the old platform such as cluttered website.">

   <div class="pain-points">
    <div class="card">No real-time tank-level input or smart gauge integration, increasing the risk of running out in cold weather.</div>
    <div class="card">Pricing opacity: unclear fees, taxes, minimum order quantities, and postcode-based pricing changes.</div>
    <div class="card">No budget or payment options (e.g., monthly plans, subscriptions, instalments, or AutoPay).</div>
    <div class="card">Weak reorder tools: no order history, favourites, or one-tap “repeat last order.”</div>
    <div class="card">Poor address and service-area validation; users could progress only to learn delivery wasn’t available.</div>
    <div class="card">Missing delivery preferences (safe-fill limit, access notes, gate codes, pets, parking/driveway constraints).</div>
    <div class="card">Limited support for multiple tanks, tank-size selection, and safe-capacity calculations.</div>
    <div class="card">Performance issues on slower rural connections; timeouts during peak demand or severe weather.</div>
    <div class="card">Trust and compliance signals were missing or buried (safety credentials, insurance, environmental commitments, GDPR/privacy).</div>
    <div class="card">Inconsistent terminology and units (litres vs. gallons), confusing price and quantity expectations.</div>
    <div class="card">Content relied on jargon and lacked reassurance, especially for winter or emergency scenarios.</div>
  </div>

  <h2>These issues led to an increase of support calls, abandoned orders, and lower trust in the platform.</h2>

            title="Image of Estela UX Designer.">
        <p>I worked on this project for approximately 18 months, with around 80% ownership.
            <br>The team included product owners, engineers, customer service specialists, heating oil partners, marketing professionals, and developers,
            <br>altogether involving around 300 people. We collaborated using platforms such as Confluence and Google Analytics, and designed for web
            <br>environments optimised for Chrome and Internet Explorer, while also ensuring compatibility with Firefox, Opera, and Safari.</p>
        <p>Designed and launched a new service that makes buying heating oil as effortless as being connected to a mains supply.
            <br>This included creating new user journeys, redesigning legacy pages, and building fresh content for the Connected Service 
            <br>across the company’s public website (www.boilerjuice.com) and mobile app.</p>
        <ul>
             <li>UX Designer (Research & Interaction Design).</li>
            <li>UI Designer (User Interface Design).</li>
            <li>Conducted user research in collaboration with the Product Owner.</li>
            <li>Collaborated with Product Owner, Engineers, Customer Service, Heating Oil Companies, Data Analysts, and Developers.</li>
            <li>Delivered user research insights, ecosystem maps, blueprint canvases, lean canvases, user flows with UX diaries, <br>and information architecture maps in collaboration with Engineers and the Product Owner.</li>
            <li>Produced wireframes and interactive prototypes with Axure and Figma.</li>
            <li>Created and maintained a design system with detailed interaction specifications using InVision.</li>
            <li>Worked with the marketing team to create digital marketing materials.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Process &amp; Approach</h2>
<h2 class="case-section">1 – Business research and discovery</h2>
<ul>
        <li>Organised a series of meetings and workshops with stakeholders, customer service teams, product managers, <br>and developers to understand both what was working well and what was not, as well as to gain clarity on the <br>new offering - the Connected Service.</li>
        <li>During this process, I used sketches and the Lean Canvas framework to quickly capture current problems, <br>business goals, value propositions, and success metrics, with the aim of achieving a market-fit product.</li>
        <li>Identified key user groups (including adults over 40 and stay-at-home parents) to map personas and capture diverse needs.</li>
        <li>Identified the key problems, opportunities, and challenges, focusing in particular on the main blockers <br>and customer pain points within the journey, as well as patterns in returning-user behaviour.</li>
        <li>Assessed how the new Connected Service might compare with the competition, and whether it could deliver <br>advantages by meeting the underserved needs of users in the current market.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="case-section">2 - Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mapped user flows in Draw.io and Sketch, capturing both ‘happy’ and ‘unhappy’ paths to anticipate <br>and address potential issues early in the design process.</li>
    <li>Created low- to mid-fidelity interactive wireframes in Axure, Sketch, Figma, and Balsamiq <br>for stakeholder review, ensuring a shared understanding of functionality and flow.</li>
    <li>Applied consistent iconography and clear, accessible headings to support usability.</li>
    <li>Redesigned the quote form to provide faster, clearer heating-oil quotes, while also enabling the <br>promotion and sale of a heating-oil subscription service.</li>
    <li>Focused on improving the end-to-end purchasing experience for heating oil. I redesigned key pages <br>in the checkout journey, including product selection, shopping cart,
        payment, and the final confirmation page, <br>to ensure a smoother, more transparent, and mobile-friendly process.
        The goal was to reduce friction, increase <br>trust at each step, and provide clear reassurance after purchase.</li>
    <li>Refined marketing propositions, placing them more strategically on the page and removing visual clutter to improve clarity and focus.</li>
    <li>Implemented consistent iconography and clear headings.</li>
    <li>Added an improved search function for faster access to key documents and data.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>BoilerJuice was a growing oil marketplace, but customers often found the ordering process clunky, price comparisons confusing, and overall trust low. 
    <br>In winter, heating oil deliveries could take one to two weeks, and many families were left without heating because the time-consuming process of requesting quotes, making payments, and arranging deliveries created delays.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase in self-serve ordering; CS calls shifted toward proactive follow-ups rather than winter emergencies.</li>
        <li>Faster quote-to-order and clearer delivery expectations, improving perceived reliability.</li>
        <li>Higher repeat usage via alerts and subscription options, strengthening loyalty.</li>
        <li>Operational resilience during peak demand due to earlier reordering and better transparency.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="outcomes">
    <p>But after UX improvements:</p>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Simplified the order flow → reduced drop-off.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Clearer price transparency → increased trust + conversions.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Seamless uninterrupted journey → allowed customers to have real-time information about heating oil levels within the comfort of their homes.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Mobile-first redesign → opened up a larger customer segment.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Personalised journeys (repeat orders, reminders) → boosted retention.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Redesigned the website to be more accessible and user-friendly → streamlining the customer journey from quote to order.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Created new quote-generation screens → made pricing clearer and ordering faster, while highlighting potential issues up front, which not only reduced customer stress but also improved the quality of interactions with the support team.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Collaborated in the creation of a new service, the Connected Service, a subscription-style model that makes buying heating oil feel as effortless as being on mains.  → This subscription-style model transformed the experience of buying heating oil into a seamless process.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Redesigned client dashboards to integrate data from a new tank device → providing customers with automatic usage readings, alerts, and clear guidelines.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Omnichannel redesign → consistent, uninterrupted experience across devices and platforms.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Peak-season resilience → support pressure reduced; calls shifted from winter emergencies to proactive follow-ups.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">Retention engine → alerts and subscription options encouraged timely reorders and sustained engagement.</div>
    <div class="outcomes-card">UX contributions  → central in turning BoilerJuice into the UK’s largest online heating oil marketplace.</div>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p> Connecting live tank data to the digital journey transformed heating oil buying from a reactive, last-minute scramble into a proactive, 
    <br>planned experience. Real-time levels, clearer quotes, and tracked deliveries increased trust and pushed more customers toward self-serve 
    <br>behaviours. The omnichannel, accessible redesign reduced seasonal pressure on support, shifted conversations from emergencies to follow-ups, 
    <br>and created a foundation for retention through alerts and subscription-style ordering. In short: less panic, more planning—and a service that finally felt as reliable as a utility.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time data &amp; alerts made usage visible and actionable, reducing winter stress and stockouts.</li>
        <li>Price transparency and a streamlined quote-to-order flow improved confidence and conversion.</li>
        <li>Omnichannel consistency + accessibility widened reach and simplified repeat ordering.</li>
        <li>Cross-functional delivery (engineering, CS, suppliers) turned UX changes into service innovation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My contribution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible, mobile-first redesign:</strong> Reworked information architecture, forms, error states, and contrast to make the experience clearer and more inclusive across web, mobile, and app.</li>
        <li><strong>Quote &amp; checkout clarity:</strong> Designed new quote-generation screens and simplified steps/copy to reduce friction and decision fatigue.</li>
        <li><strong>Connected Service (subscription-style):</strong> Co-created and redesigned the proposition and end-to-end flows so buying oil felt as effortless as a mains connection.</li>
        <li><strong>IoT-enabled dashboards:</strong> Redesigned account areas to ingest smart-tank readings; introduced low-level alerts, usage trends, refill guidance, and exception handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Proactive issue surfacing:</strong> Embedded warnings and guidance earlier in the journey, improving first-time resolution and the quality of CS interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Omnichannel orchestration:</strong> Established shared patterns and components for a consistent, uninterrupted experience across channels and devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence-driven iteration:</strong> Led discovery and validation (interviews, journey mapping, analytics, A/B tests), prioritising a roadmap that balanced user value with operational feasibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery partnership:</strong> Worked closely with engineers on specs, edge cases, and QA/UAT to de-risk implementation and speed up release cycles.</li>
    </ul>
